An initial complaint was filed at police station Dandai in Bisham Tehsil of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa invoking sections 377 (unnatural offence), 511 (punishment for attempting to commit offences punishable with imprisonment for life or a shorter term), and 506/34 (punishment for criminal intimidation) of the Pakistan Penal Code. According to the FIR, the victim, having completed his intermediate examination last Friday, was approached by the suspects, whom he was acquainted with. The suspects purportedly enticed the victim under the guise of escorting him to a riverbank before making sexual advances towards him -- actions that were met with resistance and thwarted, Dawn reported. Nevertheless, the suspects recorded the victim unclothed and issued threats to expose the footage and harm him if he reported the incident. Pakistan: Three Men Forcibly Marries Minor Girl in Sheikhupura, Converts Her to Islam; Booked Station House Officer (SHO) Dandai, Muhammad Arif Khan, disclosed that the trio implicated in the FIR was apprehended today, with further interrogation ongoing. As per the FIR, the victim was referred to the tehsil headquarters hospital, Bisham, on the day of the incident for medical examination, Dawn reported. Data collected by Sahil, an NGO dedicated to addressing child sexual abuse, reveals a disturbing trend: the majority of abusers are individuals known to the victims, such as acquaintances, neighbours, or even family members. Pakistan Shocker: Man Kills Friend for Taking Bite of His Girlfriend’s Burger in Karachi Shockingly, religious teachers and clerics emerge as the primary perpetrators within institutional settings, surpassing even police officers, school teachers, or nuclear family members in the number of complaints filed against them, according to Dawn. Primary data remains limited and organisations rely on media reports and police complaints but the trend over the past 20 years shows the gender divide of abused girls in madrassas is slightly higher than that of boys ('Cruel Numbers').

The race, covering 253.5 km done in various stages in Morocco, deep within the Sahara Desert, saw 52-year-old Lamba emerge victorious. Despite the sheer difficulty level associated with the ultramarathon – extreme temperatures of 46-52 degrees celsius, blisters on the feet, resurfacing of old injuries, dropping salt levels, and a general sense of fatigue – Lamba never doubted he would finish the race. He completed the six-stage race in 67 hours and seven minutes, competing against 900 athletes from 60 countries. The race took place from April 14 to 20. “At no point did the thought of not finishing the race even cross my mind. It’s all about mental resilience that is associated with the endurance sport,” he explains. This mindset likely stems from early advice from his father, advice he adheres to even now. He recalls a time in sixth grade when his father asked him to do push-ups and he could barely manage five or six. “My father then took charge and over the next few years trained us. By the time I was in Class 11-12, I was doing 500 of them. As I trained, my father would always say ‘one more’. To this day any time I’m pushing myself, I keep telling myself those two golden words,’’ says the fourth-generation Army officer, currently posted at the ASC Centre and College in Bengaluru.', 'Number of Words': 274}\n",

The verbal duel between BJD’s district vice-president Tapan Panda and Bhograi block president Ramakanta Karana took place in presence of the party’s Balasore Lok Sabha candidate Lekhasri Samantsinghar and nominee from Bhograi Assembly seat Gautam Buddha Das. Sources said the local BJD organised a public meeting in zone-35 of Teghari which was attended by hundreds of party workers and locals. A ruckus broke out when Tapan presided over the meeting instead of block president Ramakanta. In protest, some party workers snatched the microphone from Tapan and tried to stop the meeting. Subsequently, a war of words ensued between Ramakanta and Tapan on the stage. As the heated exchange continued for some minutes, many party workers and locals left the meeting venue. Later, Ramakanta told mediapersons that as per protocol, the block president should have presided over the meeting. However, the party’s district vice-president forcefully took over the proceedings of the meeting and presided over it. This was opposed by local BJD workers. Refuting the allegations, Tapan said party workers and local residents left the venue as the meeting started late. BJD’s LS candidate Lekhasri tried to downplay the incident and said it was a petty fight between the two leaders over a trivial matter and should not be taken seriously. Sources said the reason for the dispute was infighting in BJD’s Bhograi unit over selection of party candidates for both the LS and Assembly seat. If the BJD fails to resolve the differences, the BJP is likely to take advantage of the situation in the upcoming elections.', 'Number of Words': 290}\n",

Ravi Singh, managing the parking lot at Howrah station, noted the stark change, saying, “Before the Metro line, cabs didn’t linger here. Now they idle all day.

Those with less luggage prefer the Metro.” Indranil Banerjee, from the App Cab Operators’ Guild, expressed hope that aggregators like Ola and Uber would introduce incentives for rides between Howrah and Kolkata to boost demand. “We might not get back the commuters switching between trains and cabs, but we need to win over the local Howrah passengers again,” he concluded.', 'Number of Words': 310}\n",

We will do everything to get a good orders.Yes, I believe so. Secondly, if we talk of LTE, yes, POC preparations are on, because we are dependent on many factors for POC, we are already progressing in that. I cannot say right now that any significant progress has been made, but whenever it is there, we will share with you. As for LTE tenders, already two tenders were carried out by the railways of roughly Rs 1700-1800 crore value. One is Rs 800 plus and the other is Rs 900 plus crores.

We have been seeing a lot of churn and a lot of new customers getting added. . So, overall, we are close to 5.75 lakhs right now and because of differently bundled offerings, margins have also come down and ARPU is now around Rs 510 or so. So, this sector is going to be tough even in future years. We are continuously innovating new tariff options, new offerings and recently we have signed an MOU. It is a subsidy based model we have received from the Gujarat government where we are required to provide one lakh subscribers in the next one year. We are hopeful of adding good numbers this year.In telecom, because of competition, there has been falling tariffs though demand is there. Telecom revenue includes RailWire revenue as well and other NLD point to point circuits and MPLS circuits. There is pressure on that.

Simarjeet emphasized Bravo and Simons\\' ability to allow players to express their ideas while singling out the bowling consultant for his masterful leadership. Simarjeet produced an impactful performance with a two-wicket haul to help CSK regain winning touch with a comprehensive 28-run win over Punjab in a low-scoring IPL fixture on Sunday. \"Eric Simmons and Dwayne Bravo are amazing coaches. They give you the space to put forward your thinking. Our coach Erik is the mastermind,\" Simarjeet Singh said while speaking to Tushar Deshpande in an IPL video. advertisement Wily leg-spinner Rahul Chahar (3/23) and seamer Harshal Patel (3/24) put up a spirited show but Jadeja made a crucial 43 that came off just 26 balls to prop CSK to a par 167/9 after they were sent in to bat by Sam Curran. Comeback bowler Tushar Deshpande (2/35) and impact substitute Simarjeet Singh (2/16) also took wickets. Simarjeet picked up a wicket in his first over, dismissing Jitesh Sharma for a first-ball duck. Jadeja conceded just three runs in his next over and finished a decisive stint by dismissing Curran (7) and the in-form Ashutosh Sharma (3) in the thirteenth over. Curran felt the heat as the runs dried up and took on Jadeja\\'s wide delivery, which he slapped straight to Santner at long-off. Ashutosh then died after mistiming a big hoick and being caught by Simarjeet at third-man, giving Jadeja a three-wicket haul.

Bengaluru Water Crisis Bengaluru: The water crisis in Bengaluru continues to intensify as several lakes in the city have dried up and many other reservoirs are drying up with heatwave hitting the city hard. Of the total 800 lakes coming under BBMP (Greater Bengaluru) and Bengaluru Urban district areas, nearly 125 have gone dry this year and 25 more BBMP lakes are drying up because of the intense heatwave, TOI reported. As per the report, of the total 125 dried-up lakes, 100 are in Bengaluru Urban district and 25 in BBMP limits. Bengaluru Water Crisis Latest Update: Lakebeds Turn Cricket Pitches The BBMP said that some of the lakebeds have become cricket pitches for local boys and youngsters and there are 184 lakes in BBMP’s custody, of them 50 are in critical condition. It should be noted that the Bengaluru Urban district has over 600 lakes beyond the BBMP area, but nearly 100 of them have dried up this year as the water crisis started in the city. The BBMP added that the dried-up lakes like Nallurahalli Lake, near Whitefield, and Vibhutipura Lake have turned into playgrounds. Water Crisis in Bengaluru News: Check What Experts Believe Experts believe that the drying up of the lakes could affect the groundwater table and hinder fishing activities. The officials however hope last week’s rain will persist and the dry and drying lakes could return to life. One BBMP officer told TOI that nearly 15 lakes are being filled with treated water by BWSSB in the city and added that there is no alternative way other than this to fill lakes which are drying up, otherwise they have to depend only on rain. 986 Recharge Wells to Address Water Crisis In the meantime, with the monsoon approaching, the Bangalore Water Supply and Sewerage Board (BWSSB) said it has constructed 986 recharge wells at various locations over the last month to refill depleting groundwater levels and address the crisis. The BWSSB also added that it has mainly attributed the current water crisis in the city to inefficient rainwater harvesting and lack of proper water tanks to recharge groundwater. Speaking to Indian Express, BWSSB Chairman V Ram Prasath Manohar said that the water scarcity faced by Bengaluru city is not due to lack of water from Cauvery and added that there was a shortage because the borewells that supplied water to millions of people who depended on groundwater dried up.” He added that the construction of proper recharge wells and water tanks will not only help recharge the groundwater easily but also reduce pollution through the sluices constructed in zones.

Earlier in a 2021 interview with Parents magazine, the couple shared that the secret to their happy marriage was making sure that they prioritise each other. “Max always puts me first—smartly—which makes for a happy home.

An influential figure in critical care treatment, Dr Vincent was speaking about the future of intensive care at KIMSHEALTH in Thiruvananthapuram on Sunday. He discussed the evolution of intensive care, noting how it has transformed into more welcoming spaces. “Earlier, inside ICUs, patients who were drowsy under the effect of sedatives had no other option but to look at white ceiling for days together. There was no TV or even a clock inside these ICUs. However, the situation has now changed. Due importance is now given to a patient’s ideas and preferences,” said Dr Vincent. Vincent also introduced the concept of eCASH (early Comfort using Analgesia, minimal Sedatives, and maximal Humane care), emphasising the promotion of patient mobility within the ICU. “Patients are now encouraged to move with the respirator inside the ICU and even go outside to meet a physiotherapist or nurse. The idea is that the movement helps patients recuperate faster,” he said. Dr Deepak V, clinical director for critical care at KIMSHEALTH Thiruvananthapuram, said that the hospital allows family members to meet patients frequently and not just during visiting hours. “Unless the visits do not interfere with the functioning of the ICU or patient care activities, family members are encouraged to be with patients.

Modi ji ki wajah se huye. Pehle kahan koi shaheed hota tha? (Who caused the martyrdom? It is because of Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

And not the (terror) attacks. When elections come, such stunts are done to make the BJP win. These are pre-planned attacks, there is no truth in them…,” alleged the Congress leader. “To kill people and to play with their bodies….BJP knows it…,” he further alleged.

This mentality is not just appalling but disrespectful to those who serve our nation. Pakistan and Rahul Gandhi continue to support each other while Congress is belittling the sacrifice of our Jawans,” BJP leader Manjinder Sirsa had said.

The larger National Stock Exchange of India and its older rival BSE are wrestling for dominance in derivatives, particularly the raging options market spurred by the introduction last year of short-term contracts that can be traded with borrowed funds. The monthly notional value of derivatives traded on Indian exchanges exploded to an eye-popping ₹8,737 trillion ($104.65 trillion) in March 2024, more than double that of a year earlier, data from the regulator shows. Also read: AIFs can now issue offshore derivative instruments from Gift IFSC The NSE plans to launch options contracts based on key sectoral indices, including the pharmaceutical and IT indices, if it gets the regulatory go-ahead, according to two exchange sources. In April, it launched option contracts on a Nifty Next 50 index of the 50 largest stocks which are not in the benchmark Nifty index. It has reduced transaction fees and a wider review to further reduce charges is underway, said the sources, declining to be identified as they are not authorised to speak to the media. Not to be left behind, the BSE plans to launch options contracts based on indices of the top 50 and top 100 companies by market value, a source familiar with the exchange\\'s plans said, also declining to be identified. The exchange will launch \"complementary products\" and \"relaunch languishing products\", Sundararaman Ramamurthy, chief executive of BSE told Reuters, without elaborating. \"We do not consider ourselves in competition with NSE,\" Ramamurthy said. \"They have been very large for the last 23 years and we have just started getting traction.\" Details of the new products planned by the two exchanges have not been previously reported. BSE’s aggressive strategy has pushed up its market share in derivatives trading from less than one percent to 17% in the twelve months ending March 2024, denting NSE\\'s near monopoly on derivatives trading in India. Options volumes have rocketed as well. Of the 108 billion options contracts traded worldwide in 2023, 78 per cent were on Indian exchanges, according to data from the Futures Industry Association. Both exchanges have seen revenues rise, with the BSE reporting a 55% increase in the nine months ending December 2023 and NSE a 21 per cent increase. For NSE, 80 per cent of its revenue comes from transaction charges, for BSE it is 38 per cent as per exchange disclosures. The competition has caught the attention of market regulator, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI). Earlier this week, SEBI asked the exchanges to pay higher regulatory fees based on the notional value of derivatives traded, after which BSE raised its transaction fees. SEBI is also scrutinising the incentives given by exchanges to brokers, two regulatory sources told Reuters. The regulator is probing the practise of charging lower transaction fees for brokers with high turnover, the sources said. SEBI has not so far responded to a Reuters request for comments. An NSE spokesperson did not respond to an email seeking comment. DERIVATIVES BOOM, RISKS RISE The value of derivatives traded in India in 2023 was 421 times traditional cash trading - the highest among major global markets, Axis Mutual Fund said in a report last year. “An options contract expiring daily has definitely bumped up options trading in India,\" said Nithin Kamath, chief executive and co-founder, Zerodha, India\\'s largest broking firm. Retail investors now make up 35% of derivative trading in the country, prompting the regulator to issue repeated warnings on the risks of such trading. Indian regulators will form a panel to study the risk posed by the derivative trading surge, Reuters reported last month. Options expiring on the same day, known in technical parlance as \\'zero day to expiry\\' options, are particularly popular among retail investors. For Cusrow Sadri, 51, the wide variety of options and daily contract expiries introduced by exchanges over the past year has meant an opportunity to make higher returns. \"I made a profit of 30% on my capital last year,\" said Sadri, who quit his job in the airline industry satisfied with his \"good\" earnings via options selling. Siddharth Joshi, a 36-year old from Surat in western India, gets the opportunity to trade more because of the shorter term expiries, he said. \"The multiple expiries have helped in making a neat profit,\" said Joshi whose average trade is around 50,000 Indian rupees ($599.11). According to a SEBI study of January 2023, nine out of ten investors made losses while trading in derivatives. Nudged by SEBI, both BSE and NSE have launched investor awareness campaigns and issued warnings on risks associated with trading in options.

The city is sizzling above 43°C - as it does every summer season - but residents in the 246 green residential building projects dotting Hyderabad\\'s landscape, are not facing the heat, literally, while also saving 700-1,000 on monthly power bills . The temperature in homes within these green buildings is at least two to three degrees lower, which also translates into saving electricity.There residents here thank the green infrastructure, which has emerged as a powerful tool to combat urban heat islands and offer respite from scorching heat.\"Residing in a green building has been an ideal choice for our family,\" said P Subash Reddy, a resident of Green Grace apartments in Khajaguda. \"The design allows for plenty of natural light and ventilation, minimizing our reliance on artificial lighting. When compared to traditional houses, the indoor temperatures in green buildings are noticeably cooler. Additionally, the installation of solar-powered water heaters has led to significant savings on our electricity bills. All together, we are registering a monthly savings of at least 700 per month on power bills.\"Currently, Hyderabad has over 884 development projects that are certified as green buildings by the Indian Green Building Council ( IGBC ). The council is headquartered in the city and in fact, its 20,000 square feet office is considered among the biggest green properties in India and it is also the country\\'s first platinum rated green building.Another example is: Rainbow Vistas at Rock Garden. Here too residents share how the summers have been less taxing. \"One of the primary benefits of the green building is the increased space, which allows for a more spacious living environment. Additionally, proper ventilation ensures a healthy flow of fresh air, promoting better indoor air quality, particularly during summers,\" said Madhu Sudhan Reddy, a resident. The environment friendly features of the property includes gardening, lawns, cross ventilation, sewage treatment plants (STP) for water recycling and rainwater harvesting.According to IGBC, several government buildings in Hyderabad have adopted green building ratings, including the Integrated Command and Control Centre, Telangana Secretariat, Secunderabad, Hyderabad, and Kacheguda railway stations, Rail Nilayam building, and Rajiv Gandhi International Airport. Private organizations such as Capgemini, Dell, Waverock, D.E Shaw, K Raheja IT Park Mindspace, Inorbit Mall, Jayabheri-The Peak, My Home Avatar, Aparna Sarovar, and Rainbow Vistas at Rock Garden have also embraced these ratings.C Shekhar Reddy, vice-chairman of IGBC, attributed the transformation of Hyderabad\\'s green building landscape to the growing interest among its citizens. \"By reducing energy consumption, minimizing water usage, and promoting waste management, green buildings play a pivotal role in conserving our planet\\'s finite resources,\" he said.M Anand, deputy executive director, stated that green buildings require an additional 2% investment compared to a conventional residential project, but the investment pays back within 18 months through savings in power and water bills.To be certified as a green building, the IGBC has established a set of criteria that focus on sustainability, energy efficiency , water conservation , and environmental quality. These buildings optimize their envelopes to reduce heat and incorporate cool roof designs to mitigate direct solar heat gain, resulting in energy consumption savings of 20-30%.Green buildings utilize alternative materials such as AAC blocks and fly ash blocks for walls, efficient glass for windows, passive design strategies, and effective lighting and cooling systems.In terms of water usage, green buildings are making significant progress by reducing consumption by 30-50%. This is achieved through use of aerators and low-flow fixtures, water harvesting pits and tanks, and treating wastewater for landscaping and flushing.', 'Number of Words': 595}\n",

Credit outstanding to the housing sector rose by nearly Rs 10 lakh crore in the last two fiscals to reach a record Rs 27.23 lakh crore in March this year, according to RBI\\'s data on \\'Sectoral Deployment of Bank Credit\\'. Reason for increase: Experts attribute this to a strong revival in the housing market after the COVID-19 pandemic. People who delayed buying homes during the pandemic (pent-up demand) are now actively purchasing. Additionally, the government\\'s push for affordable housing has also fueled this growth. Here\\'s an analogy: Imagine a pool representing the total amount of money loaned for housing. Over the past two years, this pool has grown significantly, indicating a surge in home buying activity. This is likely due to people catching up on delayed purchases and government initiatives promoting affordable housing. While the pool will likely keep growing, the rate of growth might slow down a bit in the future. What should existing borrowers do to combat the pressure ? According to the BankBazaar Aspiration Index, in 2023, home ownership continued to be one of the top three goals. The demand for home loans continued its upward trajectory despite higher interest rates, and the loan book of banks grew above Rs 21 lakh crore. In 2023 -- the average home loan ticket size disbursed on Bankbazaar was Rs 28.19 lakh. For metros, the average home loan ticket size was Rs 33.10 lakh, and for non-metros, it was Rs 22.81 lakh. : Imagine a pool representing the total amount of money loaned for housing. Over the past two years, this pool has grown significantly, indicating a surge in home buying activity. This is likely due to people catching up on delayed purchases and government initiatives promoting affordable housing. While the pool will likely keep growing, the rate of growth might slow down a bit in the future. “To combat the pressure of the rate hikes, existing borrowers can explore switching to lower home loan rates and continue to prepay a part of the loan to reduce the burden,\" said Adhil Shetty, CEO, of BankBazaar.com The real estate boom decoded: Post-pandemic recovery: People who delayed buying homes during COVID-19 are now actively purchasing (pent-up demand). Government push: Initiatives for affordable housing have made buying a home more accessible. Increased demand: Reports show a significant rise in housing sales and prices across all segments, especially affordable housing. Shift in priorities: The pandemic highlighted the value of homeownership, driving demand for spacious homes with dedicated workspaces. According to the data of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on sectoral deployment of bank credit for March 2024, the amount outstanding on commercial real estate loans has grown significantly. In March 2022, it was Rs 2.97 lakh crore, and by March 2024, it had risen to Rs 4.48 lakh crore, which is an increase of Rs 1.5 lakh crore.This increase suggests that businesses are borrowing more money to invest in commercial properties. According to reports from various property consultants, housing sales and prices have surged significantly in the past two financial years. Madan Sabnavis, Chief Economist with Bank of Baroda, said the high growth in home loans can be attributed to the housing boom seen across all segments. In particular, Sabnavis said the affordable housing segment has witnessed an uptick due to the government push. \"There was also some pent up demand for buying homes in the last two years following COVID which is getting reflected here,\" he said. Sabnavis said the home loan growth would remain robust, but might taper down to 15-20 per cent due to a higher base. Commenting on the RBI data, Samir Jasuja, CEO and MD of PropEquity, a leading real-estate data and analytics company, said the rise of housing loans outstanding is primarily due to the significant increase in the quantum of properties launched and sold in the last two fiscal years. \"Major Tier-1 cities have witnessed high rates of price appreciation ranging between 50-100 per cent since FY 2021, which has contributed to an increase in average loan size per property,\" he explained. Jasuja expects the housing loan segment to remain on an uptrend as demand for residential real estate remains strong. Indian real estate sector, which supports more than 200 ancillary industries including cement and steel, has been witnessing a strong demand since 2022, after languishing for more than a decade because of subdued sales and stable prices. The real estate sector suffered on account of disruptions caused by new realty law RERA, GST and demonetisation besides trust deficit in the sector as many developers did not deliver projects after taking money from customers. However, the sector bounced back post-COVID as the pandemic re-emphasized the importance of home ownership. Industry experts believe the sector to reach $1 trillion milestone by 2030. Karthik Srinivasan, Senior Vice President and Group Head at rating agency ICRA, said the retail housing loans deployed by banks has increased significantly in FY\\'24 consequent to the merger of Housing Development Finance Corporation Ltd (HDFC) with HDFC Bank effective July 2023. \"Mortgage penetration level is steadily increasing in India (around 12 per cent as of March 2024; the amount of housing loans outstanding as a proportion of GDP), but remains relatively lower than developed economies, implying significant room for growth,\" he said. ICRA expects the trend to continue with overall housing finance expected to grow by 12-14 per cent annually in the near-to-medium term, supported by buoyant demand. Aakash Ohri, Jt Managing Director of DLF Home Developers, said there is an unprecedented surge in the demand for homes, which has reached an all-time high in the past two years, particularly in the aftermath of COVID. \"This surge underscores a fundamental shift in people\\'s perception of homeownership, where the value of having a place to call home has become more apparent than ever before. Residential real estate has not only served as a sanctuary for end-users but has also emerged as an attractive investment avenue,\" he said. Ohri further said the remarkable growth in home loan advances can be attributed to various factors, including favourable government policies, attractive financing options, and the growing aspirations of the populace for homeownership. Mohit Jain, Managing Director, Krisumi Corporation said the demand for spacious homes has truly skyrocketed and buyers are prioritising comfortable living areas and dedicated workspaces. \"We are seeing a surge in interest for properties with dedicated home offices and outdoor space features that were once considered luxuries, but are now essential for the modern homeowner,\" he said. The long-term outlook for the housing market remains incredibly strong and accordingly, home loan growth is also likely to remain strong, Jain added.

A former professor of department of Naval Architecture at IIT Kharagpur Suresh Chandra Misra attended as the chief speaker. Misra explained that polluted water is harmful to public health and its use in domestic, commercial, industrial and agricultural sectors is detrimental. “Pollutants are mostly carried through the river system, which includes, wastes from shipping operations, leaked oil, discarded fishing nets, microplastics and industrial and commercial wastes,” he said. “These waste products are illegally dumped into the river channels without carrying out proper treatment procedures. If precautionary measures are not taken immediately, the entire living world will face the disastrous consequences of water pollution in future,” Misra warned. Patro, in his speech, laid emphasis on preventing water pollution without affecting the process of development which is the need of the hour. In his welcome speech, OES secretary Jayakrushna Panigrahi said that the increase in pollution of water resources is due to a lack of awareness and sensitivity in society, which leads to several serious health hazards, including cancer. “Life is intensely dependent on natural resources and all living organisms need water for survival.

The camps were in the neighbourhoods of Lac Vert and Mugunga, near Goma, the provincial capital of North Kivu, which has seen a sharp uptick in violence over the past few months. UN Deputy Spokesperson Farhan Haq told journalists at UN Headquarters in New York that the situation around Goma continues to remain very tense, with at least 11 incidents involving explosives reported since February. Bintou Keita, Special Representative of the Secretary General for DRC and the head of MONUSCO, condemned the violence against civilians and called on all parties to the conflict to adhere to international humanitarian law and protect civilians, Mr. Haq added. The escalating violence in North Kivu in the country\\'s east has triggered a massive exodus to Goma, which now hosts over 500,000 people who have been displaced. \"Despite the volatile situation and insecurity, we and our partners continue to provide assistance,\" Mr. Haq said, also noting the need for additional funding to reach those in need with aid. He said the 2024 Humanitarian Response Plan seeking $2.6 billion is only 17 per cent funded at $430 million.

CEO of CWI, Jonny Graves, however, has allayed all fears about security. “We work closely with authorities in the host countries and cities, and continually monitor and evaluate the global land scape to ensure appropriate plans are in place to mitigate any risks identified to our event,” Graves told Cricbuzz. “We want to assure all stakeholders that safety and security of everyone at the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup is our number one priority and we have a comprehensive and robust security plan in place,” Graves added.

The BJD has failed to fulfil its many promises while corruption, bribery and theft have become commonplace in the state, he said. “Sadly, income of the farmers of Odisha is one of the lowest in the country as they are not receiving fair price for their crops. Water is not reaching to their farmland as the government could not keep its promise of providing irrigation to at least 35 per cent of the cultivable land in each block,” he said. He said Odisha has the dubious distinction of the highest rate of migration and the term ‘Dadan’ resonates in every household, indicating the extent of migration in the state. The state government seems unconcerned about the reasons behind migration and does not have any plan or programme to check it. Launching a scathing attack on the BJD government for the poor law and order situation, Nadda said, “I say with great pain that violence against women has increased significantly and the state currently tops the list for crimes against women. BJD leaders are directly or indirectly involved in cases of violence against women including rape and murder. Crime has surged exponentially and approximately 45 BJD MLAs are directly or indirectly implicated in these incidents.”', 'Number of Words': 230}\n",

This crisis has been marked by unprecedented levels of hatred and violence, unparalleled in the history of independent India. The day was observed with reverence to honour fallen heroes and innocent victims of the violence, with similar services held in other locations, including at Jantar Mantar in Delhi. In Dibrugarh, the event was organized by the Kuki Worship Service (KWS) in collaboration with the Dibrugarh Mizo Welfare Association. It was chaired by Thongminhao Haokip and began with an invocation from KWS Chaplain Joseph Thangngew, followed by greetings from Pu. Paolen Chongloi. Dr. Lamkholal Doungel, Chairman of KWS and Executive Member of Kuki Inpi Assam, delivered the keynote speech and exhortation. He emphasized the importance of standing against societal evils and moving forward, guided by the teachings of Christ, to achieve peace and unity. Dr. Doungel referred to the biblical passage Exodus 17:8–16, which recounts lessons from Aaron and Hur under Moses’ leadership. He stated, “Following after God doesn’t mean you’re free from attack, but you are free from defeat.” The service included heartfelt accounts from two survivors of the conflict: an elderly man in his 80s, Pu Letkhokam Vaiphei, and a young student of Manipur University, Boilun Haokip. They both described their harrowing experiences and the challenges they faced. Musical performances were a poignant part of the event. Lalam Hengna and Jefani Changsan performed the song “Ki khen thei ihipoi” (meaning “we can’t afford to be apart”), which gained popularity following the atrocities against the community. Ms. Cindy Haokip also sang a song promoting unity with her melodious voice. A moment of silence was observed to honour the victims, followed by prayers for peace, unity, and triumph over evil. Representatives from the Mizo Welfare Association and the Dibrugarh Inter-Church Forum (DICF) also participated in the event. The President of DICF, Denis Bird, commended the KWS for organizing the programme and expressed sorrow over the situation in Manipur. He stressed that prayer and initiatives like this are essential to bringing about change. The event concluded with closing remarks from Jampu Guite and a candlelight ceremony, symbolising hope and unity. All participants lit candles, marking the end of the solemn and impactful service.

It is being suspected that the attack was a fallout of internal conflicts within the Congress party in the Puri district. Reports indicate that unidentified miscreants attacked Rath near the Puri bus stand and quickly fled the scene. This incident occurred amid tensions within the District Congress, which began on Sunday morning when some party members vandalized the party office. The vandalism was sparked by the party’s decision to change its candidate for the Puri Sadar Assembly constituency. Initially, Sujit Mohapatra was nominated, but the All India Congress Committee (AICC) later replaced him with Rath in a revised candidate list published on Sunday. Mohapatra’s supporters were upset because he had already submitted his nomination before the change was made. This led to an outburst of anger, with supporters storming the district party office, tearing down posters and flags, damaging furniture, and protesting against state Congress leaders.', 'Number of Words': 200}\n",

A detailed investigation has been carried out into the alleged racket and a report has been drafted with the approval of the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA). The cases relate to constable exams held in 2018. The ministry has also ordered a Court of Inquiry, considering the seriousness of the matter, to fix the responsibility. Of 60 unfit candidates, 17 candidates — seven allotted to CRPF and 10 to other CAPFs — were medically examined by the Medical Officers/Board of CRPF at CRPF Recruitment Centres where 16 medical officers are involved. Talking about the report, a senior government official said in these cases, candidates have physical issues which were neglected by the doctors who cleared them as fit. “The purpose of medical standards is to ensure that medically fit candidates are accepted into the CAPFs. In these cases, candidates having Scoliosis of thoracic spine, Syndactyly of middle and ring finger of both hands and other clearly visible medical unfitness were cleared during medical examination. Later, an investigation was initiated. A communication has been sent to forces regarding such candidates along with their dossiers. However, no responsibility of officers who are involved has been fixed so far,” the senior official told News18. During medical examination, refusal to undergo the test at any stage or absenting/deserting oneself from the same renders the candidate unfit. “Any false declaration in this aspect, discovered later at any stage of service, makes the candidate liable for disciplinary action, including termination from service. In this case, the ministry has asked to fix the responsibility of officers concerned who are involved in corruption in recruitment,” the official added. After the revelation, many candidates declared unfit by the medical board have moved court, claiming to be fit, hinting at large-scale corruption in the process. It is expected that action will soon be initiated against such officers.

There\\'s a reason for that, and I\\'m a very lucky guy to be sitting here typing these words.</p></p><p><p>No – I wasn\\'t suspended, and I wasn\\'t on sabbatical. Nor was I on extended spring break in some tropical paradise, in Arizona at baseball spring training or following a rock band across the Pacific Time Zone. I would have gladly taken any of those. I can joke about it now, but at the time it was no laughing matter.</p></p><p><p>On March 14, I underwent emergency double bypass open heart surgery.</p></p><p><p>First, the grizzly details: the large artery on the left side of my heart was 80% blocked, the one on the right 60%. They were both bypassed and now functioning at 100%. My surgeon had hoped to do two more bypasses on the back of my heart, but the two arteries – which were 100% occluded – had \"crumbled\" according to my surgeon and no longer candidates for bypass.</p></p><p><p>As I said, I\\'m lucky. I was a massive coronary waiting to happen.</p></p><p><p>I was in the hospital for a week, then released into the care of my wife Cheryl and my brother Jim, who came out from West Virginia to help me get settled back home.</p></p><p><p>I am happy – very happy, in fact – to announce that my doctors expect me to have a full recovery and resume my normal, hectic lifestyle.</p></p><p><p>You aren\\'t rid of me yet.</p></p><p><p>The purpose for me writing this is two-fold. As a person who makes a living communicating though words, the process of telling my story in a public forum will help me continue processing everything that has happened – and how much is still to come.</p></p><p><p>The other reason is that if these words help one person take better control of their health situation, then my ordeal will have more than just personal meaning in the bigger scheme of things.</p></p><p><h3>How we got here</h3></p><p><p>I started having mild symptoms in the fall of 2021. It wasn\\'t pain, really. It was more like an occasional, slight discomfort right behind my sternum. I chalked it up to be overweight and out of shape from sheltering in place for 16 months during the early days of the pandemic. That\\'s what it felt like, anyway – just lightly winded from activity. Whenever I stopped moving, it went away. I didn\\'t think much of it.</p></p><p><p>I put up with that for nearly a year. I know. In retrospect, I ignored early warning signs. But it wasn\\'t debilitating, and it would go away.</p></p><p><p>During the summer of 2022, it started flaring up more often, and worse. I finally talked with my primary care about it, and she sent me for a cardiac workup. In early September I went for a stress test but couldn\\'t go more than 45 seconds on the treadmill. I was supposed to have a follow-up for a drug-induced stress test (which would have found the problem) but for whatever reason, that never happened.</p></p><p><p>Here\\'s where it gets sideways.</p></p><p><p>In October, I was helping Cheryl with a photo shoot at a sorority in Pullman – carrying and setting up lights and other equipment. The discomfort behind my sternum flared up again, but I would rest and resume. That went on all afternoon. It flared up pretty bad as we were packing up and I fought through it, figuring it would calm down on the ride home.</p></p><p><p>It didn\\'t.</p></p><p><p>I drove the entire way back with it \"acting up,\" and we went straight to urgent care. They gave me an EKG and did bloodwork, which both came back normal. After about two hours the doctor gave me some pink liquid to drink – and the pain went away. It was a numbing solution and he told me I had esophagitis and to follow up with my primary care.</p></p><p><p>For a <em>full year</em> we treated this as a G.I. problem. I had an upper endoscopy in May of 2023, which came back normal. That December I had an esophageal manometry test where they stick a probe through your nose, down your esophagus and into your stomach to test the swallowing strength. It was horrible – and again, it came back normal.</p></p><p><p>In the meantime, my original primary care left the practice, and I started seeing someone else – Aaron Drapeau, ARNP at Ironwood Family Practice in Coeur d\\'Alene. It\\'s sounds dramatic, but he saved my life.</p></p><p><h3>The revelation</h3></p><p><p>I have Type 2 diabetes, so I get bloodwork every three months. At my normal appointment in January, Aaron says, \"It doesn\\'t sound like the heartburn treatment is resolving the problem. Let\\'s talk about your chest pain.\"</p></p><p><p>So, I essentially told him the same story as above. When I got to the part where I said, \"When it flares up bad the pain goes up into my jaw,\" he visibly winced and said, \"That\\'s not heartburn, you have a heart condition,\" and he immediately sent me across the street to the emergency room. Once again, the EKG and bloodwork came back normal. The E.R. doctor wanted to admit me for further testing, but I declined and set up an appointment to do it as an out-patient instead of at the hospital.</p></p><p><p>Big mistake.</p></p><p><p>So, I finally got the drug-induced stress test on Feb. 14. The results were entered into my electronic chart later that day and before the cardiologist or Aaron had a chance to call me, I went online and read it. I came across a phrase that I\\'ll never be able to forget. \"There is a large area of severely decreased perfusion, mostly matched throughout the entire inferior wall, suggesting a scar from a <strong>prior myocardial infarction</strong>.\"</p></p><p><p>Yup. At some point over the previous two-plus years I had suffered a heart attack and didn\\'t even know it. I never had that \"holy (blank), I\\'m having a heart attack\" moment.</p></p><p><p>That triggered an office visit with cardiologist Mark Troiano, D.O., on Feb. 20, who scheduled me for an echocardiogram and heart catheterization.</p></p><p><p>In the meantime, I went to Tacoma the first weekend in March to cover state basketball, organized our spring high school sports preview, got all the spring sports schedules loaded into our database, planned our Spokane Indians season preview, and was in the process of pulling everything together for the S-R Showcase all-star basketball games.</p></p><p><p>I even shoveled a few inches of snow on March 4. Hindsight, right?</p></p><p><p>On March 12, I went to the hospital for the echo and cath. Going into it, Dr. Troiano explained there were three most likely scenarios: 1) We could treat the problem with medications; 2) I might need a stent or two and he would place them, and I\\'d be held overnight for observation; or 3) I may need to be scheduled for more invasive surgery.</p></p><p><p>When I came out of anesthesia, Dr. Troiano\\'s demeanor had changed. He explained to me that he cut the procedure short since he found so much blockage. Then came the most chilling part of the whole saga. Dr. Troiano said the first available appointment with a surgical consult was March 28, but he was admitting me that day and getting me on the list for emergency surgery because, as he said, \"If I let you leave, you might not make it back.\"</p></p><p><h3>Surgery and recovery</h3></p><p><p>I was admitted to Kootenai Health Hospital immediately and didn\\'t have to wait long to get on the surgery schedule – roughly 48 hours later I was on the operating table with my chest cracked open.</p></p><p><p>In retrospect, it was probably better that it happened that way since I didn\\'t have that much time to worry about it. In fact, once the course of action was laid out, I was pretty resolute about the whole thing – get it fixed, get out of the hospital, get healthy.</p></p><p><p>We received a lot of information in a short amount of time from a lot of different sources, and everyone there was exceptionally kind, patient, knowledgeable and helpful.</p></p><p><p>The biggest issue – at least I made it the biggest issue – during that 48-hour period was fixating on trimming my beard so that they could put an IV in my neck. We went through several stages of cutting it to different lengths and me generally acting like a big baby about it. It was more a coping mechanism – instead of dwelling on the impending life-altering surgery and lengthy rehab, I made a big deal about cutting several inches off my luxurious beard.</p></p><p><p>On the morning of March 14, I was wheeled down to the pre-operation suite, where I was met by nurse Sydney Tilleman. To take my mind off things, she asked what I did for a living. I told her and she responded, \"You must know my husband\\'s cousin-in-law, Madison McCord.\" Of course, I know Madison. A former full-time page designer and editor at the paper, he\\'s now a part-time editor, correspondent and, not coincidentally, helped with the all-star game stuff while I was incapacitated.</p></p><p><p>Then, putting two and two together, she said, \"Then you might know my husband, Beau Tilleman.\" Of course, I know Beau, who is the athletic director at Shadle Park. Talk about small worlds. Sydney and I posed for a photo, which we texted to Madison and Beau, then I was sedated and whisked off for surgery, which was performed by Dr. Tori Lennox, M.D. – who I had met just a couple of hours earlier that morning.</p></p><p><p>Surgery was the easy part. I don\\'t remember a thing from those six hours of my life.</p></p><p><p>The surgery staff was in constant contact with Cheryl throughout the procedure. After surgery, I was taken to the ICU where I was hooked up to ALL the machines. Cheryl was allowed to see me before I was awake, but she had to leave at the end of visiting hours. I came out of anesthesia late in the evening and my first memory post-op was my ICU nurse on duty, Danny, removing the breathing tube from my throat – then throwing up on myself.</p></p><p><p>As I laid there, still in the fog of anesthesia and hopped up on several pain medications and with IVs and wires and catheters sticking out of my body, I slowly realized that \"Hey, I\\'m alive.\" I started to sob, and Danny sat there and held my hand for what seemed like hours – but was probably only a few minutes.</p></p><p><p>I spent two and a half days in ICU, and another two and a half days in the cardiac care unit. Once I passed all the thresholds (eating, walking, in and out of bed under my own power, bowel movements), I was released from the hospital to come home on March 19, one week after I went in for the tests.</p></p><p><p>For that first week, I had to rely on Cheryl and Jim for some of the most basic functions of life – cooking, bathing, dressing, lifting anything heavier than 5 pounds. But every time I went to sleep, I felt better and stronger when I woke up.</p></p><p><p>The pain behind my sternum that put me in the hospital was gone. Completely gone.</p></p><p><p>On March 26, against my siblings\\' wishes and my own better judgment, I attended the S-R Showcase at Lewis and Clark High School, chaperoned by my good friend Bud Rasmussen – who drove me chauffeur style over from Coeur d\\'Alene and acted as my bodyguard so I couldn\\'t bump into anything or anyone. It might have been early in my recovery, but I thought it was important to go, and it was great to be out in public and see everyone there.</p></p><p><p>While on the subject, I would like to publicly thank the Greater Spokane League athletic directors, Lewis and Clark staff and administrators and Spokane Public Schools representatives for making sure the second annual all-star games went off without a hitch.</p></p><p><p>My recovery has been nothing short of remarkable. I have bounced back much quicker than I expected or feared. I was cleared to come back to work on April 5, cleared to drive on April 16 and covered the entire Spokane Indians homestand that week in person from the press box.</p></p><p><p>It\\'s a long walk with a lot of stairs, and my legs felt like jelly the first couple of days, but I made it from the parking lot to the press box without having to stop. I couldn\\'t have done that eight weeks ago.

In contrast, she didn\\'t sign with the Liberty until Feb. 2 last year, about three months shy of training camp.</p></p><p><p>With a better understanding of what New York coach Sandy Brondello needs from her, she knows exactly how her skill set fits alongside Breanna Stewart, Sabrina Ionescu and Jonquel Jones.</p></p><p><p>\"I feel like I\\'m still in my prime on most days,\" <a href=\"https://www.spokesman.com/stories/2023/feb/09/courtney-will-forever-be-linked-with-gonzaga-forme\" target=\"_blank\">the former Gonzaga star said</a>. \"There\\'s some days that I do feel my age a little bit more. But when I\\'m out there, I\\'m still able to move the way that I want to. My body is still in good shape in terms of that.</p></p><p><p>\"Of course, I know that I\\'m gonna run the point, but I need to be able to be efficient off the ball so Sabrina can be on the point sometimes. I think I have a much better understanding of that and just being able to be efficient when I\\'m not on the ball. That\\'s what kind of my mentality going into camp is just finding other ways to impact the game.\"</p></p><p><p>An impact even more than she has during a rather decorated career.</p></p><p><p>\"Sloot,\" as she\\'s affectionately known, won the title with Chicago in 2021. She\\'s a five-time WNBA All-Star, twice has been named to the All-WNBA first team, has lead the league in assists seven times and was named to the all-rookie team in 2011.</p></p><p><p>She also second in WNBA career assists, 533 behind Sue Bird, and people have begun asking her if the record is on her mind.</p></p><p><p>\"I try not to; if it happens, it happens,\" she said. \"But I get asked about it, so I do think about it. I\\'m gonna continue to try and just be me. And if it results in assists, it results in assists. I just want to really stay away from the, \\'Oh, I gotta break this record. I want to do this\\' (narrative). I want to be able to impact the game. I want us to win games. I want to play my role the right way and do all those things. I\\'ve played for a long time and often times those result in assists. So, I\\'m just gonna let that kind of take care of itself, if you will, and just continue to play my game.\"</p></p><p><p>The former three-time West Coast Conference Player of the Year spent her offseason in and out of New York, making public appearances for the Liberty, but more important, getting in critical runs on the court with whatever teammate was in the market at the time.</p></p><p><p>\"That, and listening to my body,\" said Vandersloot, who turned 35 in February. \"I had to take time off. I\\'m grinding and working really hard and then something pops up in my body and I have to listen to it. That\\'s the hardest part about being this age. It\\'s not always pushing through, it\\'s not always just grinding. I have to let my body recover. So that\\'s a new phase for me. I\\'m definitely learning about that while also trying to stay in shape. I have to be able to be in game shape. So, there\\'s that balance.\"</p></p><p><h3>Camp Liberty</h3></p><p><p>With a balanced of veterans and younger players, Brondello has mixed her rotations and thrown different lineups on the floor during training camp, ahead of the preseason opener in Chicago on Tuesday. By doing so, it\\'s allowed Brondello to put people in distinct positions, as Vandersloot mentioned, be it with Ionescu on the ball more, or using Stewart as a point forward.</p></p><p><!--[photo id=853175 align=left]--></p><p><p>\"Just getting us more comfortable so we can kind of fill those different roles,\" Vandersloot said. \"But also, being leaders to the younger (or) new players, being able to kind of get them up to speed a little bit faster, because they\\'ll feed off what we do on the floor and what we\\'ve already built.</p></p><p><p>\"It was important for us to keep our core together, which we did, and then just add a few pieces that we think can help us off the bench. We talked about how much our bench will help us this year with the season being as it is, the schedule being a little bit crazy. I think we added a few good pieces that will be really helpful for us off the bench.\"</p></p><p><p>Her leadership and impact are certainly being felt, as rookie Jaylyn Sherrod called Vandersloot a poised spirit.</p></p><p><p>\"I will also say she really controls the floor and just always seems two steps ahead of the defense, which as a point guard you want to do,\" Sherrod said. \"Just very, very calm (and) collected. Doesn\\'t really seem to ever get outside of herself and always thinking ahead about what she\\'s doing and how she can put her teammates in the best position.\"</p></p><p><p>It\\'s an astute observation from a rookie who just two months ago was competing in the NCAA Tournament for Colorado, when you consider one of the league\\'s best had a similar sentiment during her Media Day availability with the Seattle Storm.</p></p><p><p>\"Control, just control,\" said Storm newcomer Skylar Diggins-Smith, who faced Vandersloot in the 2022 WNBA Finals. \"Somebody that I really admire a lot, the way that she plays the game. … I always learn something about myself when I play against her on both sides of the ball. Or maybe she just exposes those things. She definitely is an all-time great in our league when it comes to point guards, and players in general.</p></p><p><p>\"Just so unselfish, always trying to get others involved. I love the way that she can command her team. She can see things two or three steps ahead, her vision. But it\\'s really just her mindset. She has an incredibly high IQ, and you could hear it on the court, the way that she puts people in places, maneuvers and manipulates on offense and defense.</p></p><p><p>\"It\\'s an honor competing against her.\"</p></p><p><h3>Mentally tough</h3></p><p><p>Vandersloot said one of the biggest things she learned later in her career is to remain disciplined in disconnecting from the game she\\'s loved since writing a school paper in third grade that detailed her dreams of playing in the WNBA one day.</p></p><p><p>\"Just being able to take a day to just do things that you enjoy, spend time with your family,\" she said. \"I lean on Allie, my wife, a lot. But to prepare for big games, I lean on the people that we\\'re in the trenches with. You have to. That\\'s why we\\'re here. We\\'ve been through a lot of things together and people in your circle, they\\'re part of this team, they believe in you. So, I make sure that I lean on them.</p></p><p><p>\"I talk to a therapist once a week, just staying on top of it, staying in front of it, because you never know. We all have lives outside of this and you never know what people are going through. It\\'s not always just to come in here and it\\'s a sanctuary. We love to think that, but sometimes you bring things in with you and it\\'s heavy and it\\'s hard to perform at that level. So, making sure that you\\'re taking care of, \\'me first,\\' that\\'s what it\\'s all about.\"</p></p><p><p>It\\'s what it\\'ll take if Vandersloot is going to play in her third WNBA Finals in four years, and second straight with New York.</p></p><p><p>\"That\\'s what I came here to do,\" she said. \"I wanted to be competing for a championship. I wanted to be in the finals year-in and year-out because there\\'s nothing better than that as a competitor. That\\'s always the goal. There\\'s a long process before that. Just making sure that we\\'re taking the right steps, we\\'re taking care of our bodies, me specifically because I am getting up there.\"<span class=\"print_trim\">am getting up there.

Here’s what analysts have to say on Kotak Mahindra Bank Q4 results and Kotak Mahindra Bank share price: JPMorgan JPMorgan upgraded Kotak Mahindra Bank to ‘Overweight’ following supportive valuations post recent RBI actions and senior management departure. The impact of the same on FY25/26 growth should be minimal and the bank showed in 4Q print that core operating metrics remain strong, JPMorgan said. It believes the bank can continue to compound balance sheet at 16% CAGR over next 2 years and even factoring ROA normalization, it thinks bank earnings can compound at 16-17% CAGR over next 2 years with scope for upside driven by better opex control. Valuations at 10x F26E parent P/E are compelling for what is a high quality and growth compounding franchise, it said. JPMorgan has a target price of ₹2,070 per share on Kotak Mahindra Bank. Emkay Global Financial Services Kotak Mahindra Bank reported a huge 28% beat on PAT, mainly on treasury gains/debt syndication fees, reversal of AIF provisions, and lower tax rate, Emkay Global said. It cut FY25E-27E growth estimates by 200 bps and expects the RoA/RoE trajectory to slip to 1.9% - 2.3% / 13% - 14%, on higher opex/provisions. Higher attrition and Bank’s strategy to reduce provision buffers vs peers amid rising asset-quality noise, adds to our concerns, it said.

The workshop was held at CSIR-NIIST campus here earlier this week in connection with World IPR Day, for which this year’s theme was ‘IPR and Sustainable Development Goals - Building Our Common Future with Innovation and Creativity.’ In his inaugural address, G M Nair, president, Kerala Academy of Sciences and Director, Central Laboratory for Instrumentation and Facilitation (CLIF), University of Kerala, highlighted the importance of enhancing awareness about IPR in general and patents in particular. Citing a case of effective scientific intervention, Nair lauded the contribution of the Jawaharlal Nehru Tropical Botanical Garden and Research Institute (JNTBGRI) scientists in the development and commercialisation of ‘JEEVANI’ from ‘Arogyapacha’ and the subsequent sharing of revenue with Kani tribes. “This was the first world model of equitable benefit sharing based on Article 8(j) of Convention on Bio-Diversity (CBD),” he noted.

He highlights contradictions in Modi's statements on the Constitution, accusing BJP of conspiring against guarantee schemes and misleading the public. BELAGAVI: Chief minister Siddaramaiah criticised Prime Minister Narendra Modi for “speaking like a Bajrang Dal worker” during his election rallies, accusing him of polarising voters on religion instead of discussing his achievements over the past 10 years.At a press conference on Sunday — barely 48 hours before the second phase of polling in 14 seats predominantly in North Karnataka, Siddaramaiah said Modi’s behaviour suggests “frustration about potentially losing these elections”.He urged the PM to focus on his achievements and promises which he has met — “if any” — rather than “engaging in politics of hatred, division, and vindictiveness”.He accused the PM of consistently lying in election rallies, saying it brought disrepute to his office and lowered the dignity of the post of PM. Siddaramaiah highlighted the contradiction between Modi’s recent remarks that the Constitution is “his religious book” and the ideology of BJP’s parent organisation RSS which he said is “bent on rewriting the Constitution”.He pointed out that several BJP MPs have openly said the Constitution will be changed if NDA secures 400 seats in the Lok Sabha, while RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat has “instructed swayamsevakss to be patient” as they will “eventually alter the current Constitution”. “So, these polls are another freedom movement to protect the Constitution, which gives equal opportunities to all,” he said.‘BJP against guarantees’ | Siddaramaiah accused BJP of conspiring to halt his govt’s five guarantee schemes. He said initially, BJP functionaries claimed that implementing the guarantees “would be financially impossible”. “Subsequently, they asserted that it would lead to insolvency and hinder development in the state,” he said.“Now, they are deceiving people by suggesting that the guarantees will be scrapped after the Lok Sabha elections .” He said he has allocated Rs 56,000 crore for the five schemes in the budget for the fiscal 2024-25. “Besides, we have allocated Rs 68,000 crore for capital expenditure including development work,” he said.“BJP which is anti-poor, anti-farmer, anti-labourer and anti-women is making false allegations and misleading people.” He said BJP will never waive farm loans. BJP stole ‘guarantee’ word: DKS | Deputy chief minister DK Shivakumar said the ongoing elections is a battle between “truth and falsehood” and accused BJP of being so “idea bankrupt” that it even “stole the word guarantee” from Congress. He said Karnataka has set an example for the nation by effectively executing the guarantees.“Karnataka is a model state because of the successful implementation of the guarantee schemes,” he said. “Due to the growing popularity of the initiatives, BJP has adopted the word and rebranded it as ‘Modi guarantee’.” Surjewala challenges PM | Randeep Surjewala, AICC general secretary and Karnataka incharge, challenged the PM to revoke nominations of six BJP candidates who said that Constitution will be changed. Surjewala said: “BJP says it will never allow the Constitution to be changed, but six candidates who spoke about changing the Constitution are contesting on BJP tickets.” He accused BJP and RSS of “constantly” attacking the Constitution, especially its provisions related to reservation for SCs and STs, pointing out that a “Constitution review committee” was formed during Atal Bihari Vajpayee’s tenure as PM and which operated under the guidance of LK Advani.\", 'Number of Words': 558}\n",

His allegations were based on the book ’Who Killed Karkare’ written by retired police officer SM Mushriff. ”As a responsible leader, the opposition leader should desist from making such comments that can help the enemy nation,” Nikam said on Sunday. Terming Wadettiwar’s statements as “false and not based on facts”, Mumbai BJP president Ashish Shelar claimed they were aimed at defaming Nikam and inciting emotions. ”We have written to the Election Commission of India seeking action against Wadettiwar who is a star campaigner (of Congress) and also against the Congress party for peddling lies,” he added. Shelar said Kasab was sentenced to death for killing innocent people after following the due process of law. Kasab was the lone terrorist who was captured alive by Mumbai police during the 26/11 terror attack by Pakistani terrorists in which at least 166 people were killed and several others were injured. Shelar wondered whether Shiv Sena (UBT) chief Uddhav Thackeray supports the statement made by the Congress leader. The Congress, Shiv Sena (UBT) and the Sharad Pawar-led NCP (SP) are constituents of the opposition Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA).

The big data breach that hit Tamil Nadu Police last week is another demonstration of weak data security infra in the country.

Protecting data goldmine | Given India’s huge population and growing digitisation, govt departments are increasingly storing massive volumes of data. This is also precisely why India is a big target for cybercriminals. Over the last couple of years there have been multiple data breaches, especially targeting the Indian healthcare sector. Last year, a server breach in ICMR compromised personal information of about 81 crore Indians who had taken Covid vaccines. In 2022, a ransomware attack at AIIMS-Delhi crippled e-hospital services. National security threat | Apart from potential harm to people whose data is being pilfered, there’s a clear national security risk here. We already have reports of Chinese data processing farms potentially collecting gigantic volumes of data from across the world, including India. Sensitive information of political leaders and VIPs falling into the hands of a strategic rival can be dangerous. North Korea is another known source of ransomware attacks. These need to be countered. Greater accountability | India’s cybersecurity infra includes agencies like the India Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT-IN). But most breaches are actually reported by foreign entities. We need to be far more proactive. Plus, there’s little accountability for data breaches. India’s data protection law gives sweeping exemptions to govt entities. But no one is penalised or fined when massive data hacks take place at their servers. A system of penalties needs to be instituted if cybersecurity infra is found wanting. That’s the only way to keep our defences tight.

Agriculture scientists and economists believe that the paddy area in the state needs to be brought down by at least 10 lh. The Bhagwant Mann-led Aam Aadmi Party government in Punjab has taken a decision to ban the cultivation of the long-duration Pusa-44 paddy variety that takes 155-160 days time from nursery sowing to harvesting of grain. The state government wants farmers to plant shorter-duration varieties such as PR-126, which mature in about 125 days and consume less water. Punjab farmers planted 3.86 lh area under Pusa-44 in 2023, down from 5.67 lh the previous year. Chief Minister Mann claimed that the reduction in area under the variety helped the state save electricity worth Rs 477 crore and 5 billion cusecs of groundwater. His government wants farmers not to plant not even a single hectare under Pusa-44 in the coming season, for which sowing of nurseries will start mid-May and transplanting of the seedlings a month later. Advertisement Why government wants PUSA-44 out Why government wants PUSA-44 out Farmers, however, aren’t happy with the decision. The reason: Pusa-44 yields 4-5 quintals of paddy grain more per acre compared to PR-126. At last year’s minimum support price (MSP) of Rs 2,203 per quintal, it translates into extra income of Rs 8,812-11,015 an acre (one hectare equals 2.47 acres). They would not want to forego this extra income. The savings in water does not matter in their calculations, given that electricity for irrigation pumps is supplied free of cost. Out of Punjab’s approximately 38 lh net sown area, rice covered an all-time high of 31.99 lh in the 2023 kharif season. That included 5.95 lh under aromatic basmati varieties and the balance 26.04 lh under regular paddy bought by government agencies at MSP. Though the area under the now-banned Pusa-44 fell substantially, farmers did not shun it completely in Punjab. They increased area under the PR-126 variety to 8.59 lh, from 5.58 lh in 2022. Buta Singh Dhillon, rice agronomist at the Punjab Agriculture University (PAU) in Ludhiana, claimed that opting for PR-126 over Pusa-44 yields better economic returns. Despite PR-126’s lower yield, the overall expenditure is significantly lower compared to Pusa-44. Farmers using PUSA-44 incur higher costs in irrigation, fertilizers, labor, and other inputs, resulting in a 29.6% higher input cost per acre. According to his survey, “If a farmer goes for Pusa-44 he would spend 36% more on preparing paddy nursery, 66.5% more on fertilizers, 40% more cost on plant protection, 36% more on irrigation, 21.6% more expense on the labour cost, 34 % on usage of tractor, 9% more on Mandi labour. In total, the input cost of Pusa-44 would be 29.6% more as compared to PR-126 per acre”. On the other side, the farmers cite higher yields, i.e. 35-36 quintals per acre from Pusa-44 against 30-32 quintals from PR-126. But Singh points to other drawbacks of Pusa-44: “Growing this variety means farmers running their tractors and also operating tubewells for longer hours. These lead to increased wear and tear of machinery and depletion of water resources, necessitating frequent and deeper digging of tube wells. Farmers don’t factor in these seemingly invisible costs, not to speak of environmental degradation”. Advertisement Also, with Pusa-44 being transplanted during June 15-30 and harvested from October-end to first week of November, farmers have a very short time window for wheat, which has to be sown by mid-November. They then find it difficult to manage the left-over paddy stubble after combine harvesting, forcing burning and causing air pollution. As against this, PR-126, transplanted even in late-June or early July, can be harvested by early-October, providing a 30-40 days window for stubble management. Pusa-44 also produces 2-3% more stubble as compared to PR-126. With over 70% of blocks in Punjab under the dark zone for groundwater, the state faces a looming crisis. The Punjab government attributes the declining water table to paddy cultivation and has taken measures to regulate paddy transplantation to conserve groundwater resources. However, these regulations have also contributed to air pollution issues due to stubble burning. Promoting shorter-duration, less water-intensive varieties like PR-126 could offer a sustainable solution to Punjab’s agricultural and environmental challenges when actual diversification is not happening.', 'Number of Words': 730}\n",

The election is crucial for Shettar's political survival as he navigates a challenging campaign in the constituency. BELAGAVI: For former chief minister Jagadish Shettar (68), BJP candidate from Belagavi Lok Sabha constituency, this election is of immense significance as he is fighting for his political survival. Shettar switched over to Congress after being denied a ticket by BJP in the assembly elections a year ago.Congress gave him a ticket and he lost to the saffron party’s Mahesh Tenginkayi.Yet, Congress made him an MLC as he is a prominent Lingayat face in north Karnataka. Shettar returned to the saffron fold in Jan this year. And now, he is pitted against Congress’s Mrinal Hebbalkar , son of women and child welfare minister Laxmi Hebbalkar .Mrinal is contesting for the first time. Shettar’s real battle, however, is against Laxmi, who has proven her mettle in politics repeatedly over the past few years. In his quest for victory, the former CM is now leveraging his extensive political experience.Though Shettar wanted to contest from Dharwad or Haveri, the party assigned him Belagavi, where he had to contend with a ‘go back’ campaign from local leaders. But he has managed to normalise the situation gradually. On the other hand, Laxmi is tirelessly campaigning in the scorching heat to secure her son’s victory in Belagavi. Her brother, Channaraj Hattiholi, is also toiling hard.If Mrinal emerges victorious, it will establish another family with significant political clout in the district. Congress holds five out of eight assembly segments in the constituency — Belagavi (Rural), Bailhongal, Ramdurg, Savadatti, and Belagavi (North). BJP, on the other hand, holds three assembly segments — Belagavi (South), Gokak and Arabhavi. Congress’ strategy & BJP’s counter Laxmi has effectively cranked up the “outsider” narrative against Shettar, who, however, has vowed to make Belagavi his new home and has even taken a house on rent.But that has not stopped Mrinal from appealing to voters to give him a chance to serve. “It’s an issue of Belagavi’s pride,” says Laxmi. BJP found itself on the back foot when Laxmi played the ‘ Panchamasali ’ card, claiming that the blood of 19th-century freedom fighter Kittur Rani Channamma flows in her and her son’s veins.This narrative persisted for a week until former minister Murughesh Nirani claimed that Laxmi is not a Panchamasali but a Banajiga and accused her of lying about her caste for votes. He said Laxmi’s husband, Ravindra, is a Banajiga by caste, and Laxmi and her son carry the same.Laxmi tried to salvage the situation by getting Panchamasali seer Basavajaya Mrityunjaya Swami of Kudalasangama to say, “We consider Laxmi as one of us because she supported the Panchamasali reservation movement”. Congress is alleging that despite being a CM and district minister of Belagavi twice, Shettar did nothing for the constituency.They claim that instead of bringing new projects to Belagavi, he took away those meant for the city to Hubballi and Dharwad. “Shettar took away even the oxygen cylinders sanctioned to Belagavi during Covid pandemic to Hubballi,” the party claimed. Shettar has rubbished the allegations. The Jarkiholi factor BJP MLAs from Gokak and Arabhavi — Ramesh Jarkiholi and Balachandra Jarkiholi — and their brother and Independent MLC Lakhan Jarkiholi, have openly supported Shettar.If Shettar emerges victorious, the brothers will not only claim credit but also fulfil their aim of checkmating Laxmi’s emergence as a leader with influence across the district. Conversely, Satish Jarkiholi, a minister in the Siddaramaiah-led cabinet, has been entrusted with the responsibility of securing victories for the party in both Chikkodi and Belagavi seats in the district.Satish is not only campaigning across Belagavi Lok Sabha constituency in support of Mrinal, but also taking care of his own daughter’s election campaign in Chikkodi seat. Caste calculations The constituency has 5.5 lakh Lingayats, 2.8 lakh SC/STs, 2.7 lakh Marathas, 2.2 lakh Muslims and 1.9 lakh Kuruba (shepherd community) voters.Brahmins account for 60,000 voters and the remaining 3.4 lakh votes are distributed among other communities, including Upparas. Maratha votes The Maratha community , with nearly 2.7 lakh voters, has traditionally supported BJP due to its Hindutva ideology, significantly impacting the Belagavi Lok Sabha election.However, things have changed over the past few years and a Maharashtra Ekikaran Samiti (MES) candidate in the fray resulted in incumbent MP Mangala Angadi winning by a narrow margin of just 5,000 votes in the 2021 by-election.MES has fielded its candidate, Mahadev Patil, this time, too. But Satish Jarkiholi has maintained a strong influence over the Maratha votes during the past few years, and that is likely to benefit Congress in this election.\", 'Number of Words': 776}\n",

Congress holds the edge in assembly segments, while BJP banks on support from 3 of 4 Jarkiholi brothers.Tan the Congress’ strategy of fielding Samyukta Patil — a political novice — thwart BJP’s bid for a record win? This question is debated across the constituency. If BJP’s PC Gaddigoudar wins, he’ll be the first to win five times on the trot; Samyukta, in case of a win, will be the first woman MP.BJP veteran Ramesh Jigajinagi, seeking a fourth consecutive term, faces the Congress’ Raju Alagur in a battle where the saffron party relies on Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s magic and its opponent on the state govt’s guarantees. That one of the Congress MLAs is backing Jigajinagi adds flavour to the neckand-neck fight.AICC president Mallikarjun Kharge’s family is engaged in a high-stakes battle to reclaim the seat it lost to BJP’s Umesh Jadhav in 2019. Kharge, who held sway as a titan until 2019, has fielded son-in-law Radhakrishna. For Congress, a strong performance could refuel its prospects in the region.In this heated battle between Congress’ G Kumar Naik and BJP’s Raja Amareshwara Naik, the former is banking on Muslim, Kuruba, SC/ST votes while the BJP hoping for Lingayat and Hindutva support. However, absence of influential leaders such as Shivana Gouda Nayak and Raju Gowda from BJP’s campaign is a concern.faces unprecedented anti-incumbency against Union minister Bhagwant Khuba on its strong turf. Congress has fielded Sagar Khandre, the state forest minister’s son, to capitalise on BJP’s internal squabbles. Campaigns revolve around Khuba’s inefficiency and the Congress’ promise of a fresh alternative. Lingayat, Muslim and Kuruba votes will be crucial.Orthopaedic surgeon Dr Basavaraj Kyavater (BJP) and K Rajasekhar Hitnal (Congress), who lost to BJP in 2019, are in a direct fight. Both face challenges: Congress is battling resentment and BJP lacking effective campaigning. Lingayats can swing results, but it will depend on whether the Modi factor & Hindutva work or Congress’ guarantees.The contest is shaping up as a battle between Modi factor and Congress’ guarantee schemes in Karnataka. BJP has fielded B Sriramulu, while Congress has nominated incumbent MLA E Tukaram. Both parties are engaged in aggressive campaigning and Sriramulu aims for a political rebirth after his recent assembly election defeat.Both Basavaraj Bommai (BJP) and Anandaswamy Gaddadevaramath (Cong) have local ties. While they have avoided criticising each other — they belong to the dominant Lingayat community, although different sub-castes — they are attacking each other’s parties’ performance. What will work: 10 years of BJP at Centre or Congress’ 10 months in the state?Pralhad Joshi’s quest for a fifth win faces hurdles: Anti-incumbency and Congress guarantees. The Congress strategically fielded Vinod Asooti, an OBC Kuruba youth, aiming to unite Ahinda votes, marking their first serious non-Lingayat challenge in 25 years, while Lingayat seer Dingaleshwar Swami is campaigning against Joshi, alleging suppression of Lingayat leaders.BJP has denied longtime MP Anantkumar Hegde a ticket & fielded former speaker Vishveshwara Hegde Kageri . Congress has nominated former MLA Dr Anjali Nimbalkar, hoping its guarantee schemes will give her an edge. Kageri lacks Hegde’s oratory skills, and the latter’s absence from the campaign could hurt him.Given that independents and small parties seldom win LS elections from Karnataka, the candidate selection by both major parties in this head-on fight gives hope of at least one woman MP going to Parliament from Karnataka this time. The question is who will it be: Prabha Mallikarjun (Congress) or Gayatri Siddeshwara (BJP)?Children of former chief ministers S Bangarappa and BS Yediyurappa are locked in a political battle. Congress has Geetha Shivarajkumar, while BJP’s candidate is BY Raghavendra. The contest has been intensified by former minister KS Eshwarappa’s rebellion against BJP and Yediyurappa. All three are campaigning aggressively, banking on their respective support bases.5 Interesting FactsTwo former chief ministers of Karnataka — Basavaraj Bommai from Haveri and Jagadish Shettar from Belgaum — are fighting for survival of different kinds. For Shettar, who had lost on a Congress ticket in the 2023 assembly polls and has returned to BJP, this election could either give a second lease of life or end his political career. In Bommai’s case, although he won the MLA election, his party’s poor performance saw him miss out on being named the leader of opposition.Karnataka has the dubious distinction of giving women the least chance to win, going by past elections — analysis of data from 1996 shows only 5% get elected — but with both Congress and BJP fielding women in Davanagere, one woman will definitely enter Parliament.Of the 15 BJP MPs in Karnataka denied ticket, the seats of six are voting on May 7. Notable areAnantkumar Hegde (Uttara Kannada), Mangala Angadi (Belgaum), Karadi Sanganna (Koppal), and Y Devendrappa (Bellary). There are also MPs like Shivakumar Udasi (Haveri), who backed out from contesting, thereby prompting the party to field a fresh candidate in the seat.In continuation of a trend in North Karnataka, Lingayats dominate candidate lists of Congress and BJP for the 14 Lok Sabha constituencies. Of the 14 seats, four — Bijapur, Gulbarga, Raichur & Bellary — are reserved seats and in the remaining 10 seats, two (Uttara Kannada and Dharwad) have no Lingayats. The rest of the seats have at least one Lingayat in the fray, while five of them (Belgaum, Bidar, Haveri, Davanagere & Bagalkot) have a Lingayat v/s Lingayat contest.Ten of the 14 seats going to the polls — Chikkodi, Belgaum, Bagalkot, Gulbarga, Bidar, Raichur, Koppal, Haveri, Dharwad, and Davanagere — have at least one debutant to electoral politics in the fray.

This adjustment likely stems from the rising costs associated with memory and flash storage components. Vivo X100 Ultra (rumored) The Vivo X100 Ultra’s top-tier model, featuring 16 GB of RAM and a whopping 1 TB of storage alongside satellite connectivity, will command a price of 8,499 Yuan, translating to approximately $1,180. The 16GB+512GB variant follows closely behind at 7,499 Yuan, around $1,040, while the 12GB+256GB option offers a more affordable alternative at 6,699 Yuan, roughly $930. The leak also states that it will go on sale on May 28. Vivo X100 Pro, X100s price (rumored) In comparison, the Vivo X100s Pro will be available in similar configurations as the X100 Ultra but at slightly lower price points. The 16GB+1TB variant will lead the pack at 6,199 Yuan, equating to approximately $860, followed by the 16GB+512GB model at 5,599 Yuan, about $775. The 12GB+256GB iteration will have a price tag of 4,999 Yuan, roughly $695. The Vivo X100s will be available in four options, starting with the 16GB+1TB version, which will be priced at 5,199 Yuan, approximately $720, while the 16GB+512GB and 16GB+256GB options will be available for 4,699 Yuan (~$650) and 4,399 Yuan (~$610) respectively.

Did you know Dev Anand was banned from wearing black after his fan died by jumping from Qutub Minar? Bollywood has witnessed its share of intense fandom, with some fans going to extreme lengths to express their love including tragically taking their own lives for their favourite actor. Today, we will talk about one such superstar who has a crazy fanbase. We are talking about Dev Anand, who is known as one of the greatest and most successful actors in the history of Indian cinema. But do you know he was banned from wearing black? Well yes, today will talk about his life and the struggles that he had due to stardom. Early life: Anand, born Dharamdev Pishorimal Anand on September 26, 1923, in Punjab, British India, hailed from a family of prominence. After completing his BA in English literature from Government College, Lahore, Anand moved to Bombay in the early 1940s. Career He worked in the military censor's office before joining an accounting firm. Inspired by Ashok Kumar's performances, he entered the film industry, landing his first lead role in Hum Ek Hain (1946). During filming, he befriended Guru Dutt, forming a pact to support each other's careers. Love life In the late 1940s, Anand starred opposite singer-actress Suraiya in several successful films like Vidya (1948) and Jeet (1949), sparking a romantic relationship. However, their love faced obstacles due to religious differences, leading Suraiya to remain unmarried. Despite their on-screen chemistry, Anand sought roles to showcase his acting abilities independently. He often discussed his relationship with Suraiya in interviews, both during her lifetime and after her passing. Dev Anand affectionately called Suraiya Nosey, and she referred to him as Steve. Despite plans to marry during the filming of Jeet in 1949, Suraiya's family became the reason for the break up. They also threatened to kill the actor. Suraiya remained unmarried, while Dev Anand wed Kalpana Kartik in 1954, with whom he had two children. Banned from wearing black Following a tragic incident where a female fan died by suicide after jumping from Delhi's historic Qutub Minar, the Bombay High Court banned the actor from wearing black because his fan often got mesmerised seeing him in black. Despite this setback, Dev Anand's impact on Indian cinema remains unparalleled. He was India’s favourite style icon who redefined men's fashion.

Another chimed in, “Bros need reach not to be a solution,” while a third exclaimed, “When you have to resort to Twitter to ask your neighbor.” The fourth remarked, “You can call 100 and they will do the needful .

Top brokerage firms have retained their previous recommendation on Titan stock, but some have trimmed their estimates due to gold inflation and the stock\\'s fair valuation. Let\\'s take a look at what some of them say: Motilal Oswal Financial Services Motilal maintained a buy call on Titan stock with a target price of ₹4,100. It said Titan remains its top consumer discretionary play in India. However, the brokerage firm cut its earnings per share (EPS) estimates by 6 per cent and 5 per cent for FY25E and FY26E, respectively. The brokerage firm believes the near-term growth outlook of Titan appears subdued due to high gold inflation affecting demand sentiments. This, however, is a typical trend during inflationary periods. \"Despite the near-term jitteriness, the company remains aggressive in its growth outlook, driven by new store additions, attractive designs, and market share gains, et al. Titan also maintains a Jewelry EBIT margin of 12-13 per cent for FY25. We will monitor the near-term consumption trend,\" Motilal said. Motilal underscored that Titan is on track to achieve the existing jewellery revenue guidance of 2.5 times FY22 revenue by FY27, implying an impressive 20 per cent CAGR during the period. The brokerage firm believes with a current market share of nearly 8 per cent in a sizable nearly ₹5 lakh crore market, there is significant headroom for growth for Titan.

It has trimmed the FY25/26E consolidated jewelry EBIT margin estimate by 90-110 bps and cut EPS estimates by 5-8 per cent. \"We raise FY25-26E jewellery sales growth by 2 per cent and reduce jewellery EBIT margin by 90-110 bps; net result: 5-8 per cent EPS cut.

The stock is priced for perfection; we would keep an eye on the adoption of lab-grown diamonds in India (and Titan’s studded share) and Aditya’s Birla Group’s upcoming jewellery foray,\" Kotak added. JM Financial JM Financial maintained its buy call on the stock but cut the target price to ₹3,825 from ₹3,940, citing Titan’s March-quarter earnings were below expectations. \"Revenue was inline, but lower margin across segments (weaker gross margin in jewellery and the lack of operating leverage in other segments) drove an overall nearly 3 per cent miss on segment profits. The performance of the watches and eyewear segments has been volatile, and more work is needed before it reaches a steady state,\" JM Financial said. The brokerage firm believes growth and margin will likely be impacted in the near term due to volatility in gold prices, elections and lower wedding dates. However, JM Financial pointed out that for the full year, Titan will target maintaining its jewellery division growth momentum and it reiterated 12-13 per cent margin guidance.

Consequently, any potential downward revisions in earnings forecasts could pose a risk of corrections in the market over the next 2-3 quarters,\" he warns in an interview to ET Markets. Edited excerpts from a chat:: India\\'s compelling narrative of robust economic growth, fuelled by ongoing reforms and government spending into core areas, has attracted investors eager to be part of this growth trajectory. Even minor corrections prompted by non-fundamental news have become opportunities for investors to enter the market, capitalizing on businesses available at comparatively lower prices than the recent past. The fear of missing out (FOMO) further motivates sidelined investors to seize these dips.Moreover, with positive sentiments surrounding the election outcome, there\\'s a prevailing belief that current spending and reforms will persist into the next term, potentially even accelerating. This optimism fosters hopes of sustained growth momentum, driving investor behavior.The present market seems to be fairly priced based on FY25 earnings estimates, with most sectors trading at rich valuations or fair valuation. Interestingly, there are very few opportunities available at reasonable valuations today, one amongst them is banks. Moreover, there are looming risks to earnings growth over the upcoming quarters, primarily due to persistently weak consumption trends and the possibility of reduced government spending during election periods. Given the elevated expectations and rich valuations, there is no room for any error.Consequently, any potential downward revisions in earnings forecasts could pose a risk of corrections in the market over the next 2-3 quarters.So far, the results have generally met expectations, with banks experiencing slight moderation in loan growth and reaching the peak of Net Interest Margins (NIMs). The auto sector has seen marginal disappointment due to lower-than-expected margins. Conversely, the insurance sector has performed well, surpassing low expectations. However, the FMCG sector is experiencing a lower growth trajectory without any signs of business momentum pickup. Additionally, export-oriented sectors like IT have witnessed deterioration due to poor global sentiment.Overall, we are observing the results cautiously and anticipate a period of growth moderation spanning 2-3 quarters compared to the previous few quarters.When it comes to Public Sector Undertakings (PSUs), blanket generalizations are not appropriate as each PSU operates differently. We have indeed witnessed significant improvements in efficiency metrics such as margins and Return on Equity (ROE) across various PSU companies, including those in power utilities, defense, energy, and banking sectors. While some of these companies are currently trading at relatively high valuations, others remain reasonably priced. We feel confident in holding onto select PSUs where valuations remain reasonable.The primary drivers of stock price returns revolve around earnings growth and reasonable Return on Capital Employed (ROCE), amongst other things. Many companies within these thematic sectors have experienced an improvement in their growth metrics, accompanied by improving ROCE trends. Although valuations have become somewhat elevated based on a one-year forward basis, the potential for further returns hinges largely on the duration and pace of earnings growth for these companies.Considering the current expenditure plans, sectors such as power, defense, railways and water are poised to witness ongoing capital expenditure. Therefore, while the potential for significant rerating may be limited, there remains the possibility of upside driven by growth prospects.I\\'m optimistic that exercising patience with these financial giants will yield rewards, given the strong franchises they\\'ve built. While they\\'re currently grappling with short-term setbacks, once they navigate through these challenges, they\\'re likely to resume their journey of wealth creation. Importantly, these banks have become quite attractively priced compared to their recent history, with many of their fundamental business dynamics remaining sound.Asset allocation relies on numerous factors beyond understanding an investor\\'s risk profile, making it unique to each individual. At DSP, we release a periodic report called \"The Navigator,\" offering in-depth insights into asset allocation guidance tailored for various investor profiles. Based on the information you\\'ve provided, I suggest allocating roughly 30-40% in diversified funds such as Flexicap or Multicap, around 20-30% in mid and small-cap funds and the remainder in multi-asset allocation funds.

I played an apsara [fairy] in Shakuntalam with Samantha [Ruth Prabhu]… So when I play, as an actor, actually I am enjoying the liberty and freedom of being an actor today.

A lot of great opportunities are coming for every actor.” ADVERTISEMENT She further continued, “So, today I am thinking as an actor if I do get a role where they say you have to look older than Ajay, and play his mother\\'s role, I would take it as a challenge as an actor.

According to the report published by the Indian Express, the deceased boy, Shaurya Kalidas Khandve, affectionately known as Shambhu, was a passionate sports enthusiast with dreams of a wrestling career. He was bowling during a night game when a hit ball struck him, causing him to collapse. Despite being rushed to a nearby private hospital, he was declared dead by attending physicians.

Maharashtra: 18-Year-Old Boy Shot Dead By Friend After Drunken Brawl in Thane; Two Arrested. In September last year, a 15-year-old boy died after a javelin thrown by another student during a practice session pierced his head at a school in Maharashtra’s Raigad district. Hujefa Daware had bent down to tie his shoelace and didn’t realise the pointed object was moving towards him. The incident occurred at INT English School at Purar, Goregaon, in the Mangaon taluka of the district, when students were practising javelin throwing at the school's ground, he said. Daware was also a part of the javelin team preparing for a taluka-level meet. As the practice session was underway, a fellow student hurled a javelin. However, Daware apparently failed to notice that the long stick with a pointed end was flying in his direction. The teen was hit in the head when he bent down to tie his shoelace.

India topped the remittance global chart in 2023 with an inflow of $125 billion, or 3.4% of GDP. That was a direct boost to the income of millions of families. As a report in TOI (The Great Indian Outplacement, May 5) showed, a number of families that benefitted from it would have to thank children who are engaged in blue-collar work. People are our greatest asset, if govts take steps to harness this resource. Structural driver | We are in a century of demographic transformation. Wealthier countries are aging rapidly, leading to labour shortages. There’s no way to offset this problem except through immigration. This is where India scores. Our median age is around 29, and we are home to millions of eager young people who are willing to fill the gaps in the labour market for blue-collar work. Kerala alone has people working in 182 countries, which is just 11 short of the full membership of the UN general assembly. States take the initiative | Blue-collar workers are vulnerable to exploitation by agents because they lack the means to gather adequate information on potential employers. Many states have stepped in to fill that gap, for which they deserve praise. Kerala has a long tradition of doing so, but the initiative of states such as Telangana, Haryana and Jharkhand is impressive as it’s a purposeful way of matching the needs of overseas employers with job aspirants in many areas, including skilling. GOI can be a force multiplier | In future, all states will do well to have an emigration minister. However, given the structural factors shaping the global labour market, GOI needs to play a far more proactive role. Emigration minister | The next govt should have a standalone minister for emigration. This cannot be an ornamental post. Given the paramount importance of jobs, this ministry will be at the heart of India’s economic policy. It will have to liaise with MEA, skill development ministry and states. To make it effective, it will need the full backing of the PM. Robotics and AI are crunching labour demand in manufacturing. Services are an alternative growing in importance. To realise this potential, economic policy needs to use govt’s reach to plug gaps between individual aspirants and potential employers everywhere. It’s not just about ensuring the safety of workers. Appropriate skilling through agencies such as NSDC will provide young Indians a competitive edge. Coordinating all this should be the job of the emigration minister.

Qantas agreed to settle the suit by paying a AU$100 million fine to the Australian government and a projected AU$20 million to more than 86,000 affected customers. “Today represents another important step forward as we work towards restoring confidence in the national carrier,” Qantas chief executive Vanessa Hudson said in a statement. “When flying resumed after the COVID shutdown, we recognize Qantas let down customers and fell short of our own standards. We know many of our customers were affected by our failure to provide cancellation notifications in a timely manner and we are sincerely sorry,” said Hudson, who replaced Alan Joyce at the airline’s helm in November last year. A Federal Court judge has yet to accept the settlement. ACCC chair Gina Cass-Gottlieb said Qantas’ payments of AU$225 to domestic ticket holders and AU$450 for international bookings were in addition to other remedies already provided by Qantas, including alternative flights and refunds. “We are pleased to have secured these admissions by Qantas that it misled its customers, and its agreement that a very significant penalty is required as a result of this conduct,” Cass-Gottlieb said in a statement. “Qantas’ conduct was egregious and unacceptable. Many consumers will have made holiday, business and travel plans after booking on a phantom flight that had been cancelled,” she added. Qantas also admitted its misconduct continued until August last year, more than a year longer than the regulator has alleged in court, Cass-Gottlieb said. The regulator initiated the suit a week after Qantas posted a record profit for the fiscal year that ended June 30, 2023, following years of losses due to the pandemic. Its underlying profit for 2022/23 before tax was AU$2.47 billion , compared to a AU$1.86 billion loss in the previous year.

It might sound strange, but some experts believe that it could help clear up brain fog and improve how our brains work. Content creator and NHS doctor Dr Karan Rajan explains in his reel, “If you start brushing your teeth with your non-dominant hand, you probably will build some new neuronal connections in your brain.” Brain fog makes you feel fuzzy and unable to think clearly. It can happen when you’re stressed, tired, or just not feeling your best. But could something as simple as using your other hand to brush your teeth really make a difference? View this post on Instagram A post shared by Dr Karan Rajan (MRCS MBBS BSc) (@drkaranrajan) Neha Cadabam, senior psychologist and executive director at Cadabams Hospitals says, “There’s currently limited scientific evidence directly linking brushing teeth with the non-dominant hand to improved cognitive function or reduced brain fog. Brain fog is a subjective experience, and research on its causes and solutions is ongoing.” Advertisement However, she adds, studies suggest that stimulating the brain through novel activities can enhance cognitive function. Brushing with your non-dominant hand might provide a small degree of cognitive challenge. Potential neurological mechanisms that might positively impact brain regulation or cognitive clarity Cadabam informs, “The theory behind this practice lies in neuroplasticity, the brain’s ability to adapt and form new neural connections. Using the non-dominant hand forces the brain to engage different neural pathways to perform a familiar task.” This increased activity could potentially strengthen existing connections and create new ones, possibly leading to sharper cognitive function. However, she confirms that more research is needed to understand the specific neural mechanisms at play. Games and exercises designed to challenge memory, attention, and processing speed can improve cognitive performance. (Source: Freepik) Games and exercises designed to challenge memory, attention, and processing speed can improve cognitive performance. (Source: Freepik) Could regularly engaging in activities that challenge the non-dominant hand potentially lead to long-term cognitive benefits? While there’s limited evidence for immediate brain fog relief, using the non-dominant hand for daily tasks might offer some long-term benefits. “Regularly engaging in activities that challenge your motor skills can potentially stimulate neuroplasticity, the brain’s ability to adapt and form new connections,” remarks Cadabam. Advertisement This could lead to improved cognitive reserve, the brain’s resilience to decline as we age. However, the observed effects might be subtle and require consistent practice over a prolonged period. Lifestyle factors or interventions recommended to promote cognitive health and clarity According to Cadabam, the following lifestyle changes can be made to improve cognitive health and clarity: Exercise: Regular physical activity has been shown to improve cognitive function by increasing blood flow to the brain and promoting neurogenesis (growth of new brain cells). Mindfulness and Meditation: These practices enhance focus and concentration, potentially reducing feelings of mental fog. Advertisement Cognitive Training: Games and exercises designed to challenge memory, attention, and processing speed can improve cognitive performance. Sleep Hygiene: Prioritising quality sleep allows the brain to consolidate memories and clear waste products, promoting cognitive clarity. Balanced Diet: Maintaining a healthy diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and omega-3 fatty acids provides essential nutrients that support brain function.', 'Number of Words': 535}\n",

Bryce had just turned 18 when she played her first qualifier in 2015 in Thailand and Scotland narrowly missed out on a spot at the 2016 T20 World Cup when losing to Ireland in the semi-finals of that event. Three further failed campaigns on and Bryce finally fulfilled her goal when she produced a Player of the Match performance in the semi-finals against Scotland\\'s conquerors in 2015 and guided her side into this year\\'s event in October. \"There have been so many people playing before us and so many different people playing at that first qualifier we played at in Thailand.

The victory was extra special for Bryce who has played the majority of her international career alongside younger sister Sarah, with the duo unbeaten at the crease when Kathryn hit the winning runs off Ireland spinner Eimear Richardson in the 17th over of the cut-throat contest. \"It is crazy to think we had our first Qualifier back in 2015 for each of us and the first one for Scotland was in 2008.

What a journey it has been. I feel so lucky to have done it alongside you as my sister. To experience many lows and finally have a crazy massive high,\" Sarah added. While Scotland has achieved what they desired by earning a spot at this year\\'s T20 World Cup, they can finish the Qualifier tournament on a high by defeating Sri Lanka in the event\\'s final on Tuesday. Sri Lanka thrashed Scotland by 10 wickets during the group stages of the event and Kathryn knows her side must put the emotion of qualifying for the tournament later in the year behind them and finishing off the Qualifier in style.

According to a release issued by the All India Congress Committee (AICC), the party has nominated Akshaya Acharya as its candidate from Nilagiri Assembly constituency in Balasore district. Acharya is a senior Congress leader who had won from the seat in the 1995 election. Besides, the party has replaced Debi Prasanna Chand, a former MLA from Jaleswar with Sudarsan Das for the Assembly segment. Das had contested from the seat on a Congress ticket and had finished third behind minister of state for Excise Aswini Kumar Patra. BJP candidate Jaynarayan Mohanty had finished second. Similarly, the party has fielded Himanshu Chaulia in place of Bijayananda Chaulia from Athamallik seat in Dhenkanal. Sudarshan Sahoo has been nominated for the Athagarh Assembly seat in place of Maheboob Ahemad Khan. With this the party has announced candidates for 20 Lok Sabha and 143 Assembly seats.', 'Number of Words': 290}\n",

Currently, Dalits have a poor presence in entrepreneurship and industry ownership across the country – according to the MSME (Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises) Development Commissioner’s report for 2020, ownership of MSME units in India by Scheduled Caste entrepreneurs was only 8.9 per cent, while for Scheduled Tribe entrepreneurs it was only 2.9 per cent of the total. The majority of SC-ST are first-time entrepreneurs with zero business experience and lack credible collateral and credit history to offer lenders. Furthermore, the absence of mentoring, inadequate access to capital, poor marketing skills, repressive social attitudes and rampant discrimination also restricts their growth. Dalits can play a key role in revitalizing Indian Economy Overall, Indian MSMEs form the bedrock of the country’s economy. Over 63 million MSME units directly contribute 30% of the GDP, engage 40% of India’s workforce, generate 45% of manufacturing output and account for 40% of exports. If India has to realise its dream of becoming a USD 5 trillion economy, it is imperative that we embrace inclusive growth by nurturing the entrepreneurial and innovative spirit amongst Dalits. In recent decades, governments have taken noteworthy steps for their mainstreaming in economic growth. Setting up of state backward class development corporations was a major structural initiative, for example, Mahatma Phule Backward Class Development Corporation in Maharashtra. Besides this, state finance corporations were mandated to financially support the underserved by way of soft loans to SC-ST entrepreneurs. Recently, Tamil Nadu disbursed capital subsidies under its flagship scheme NEEDS to promote first-generation underserved entrepreneurs, while Uttar Pradesh provides a 2% additional subsidy to SC-ST and women entrepreneurs. The Reserve Bank of India has made it mandatory for banks and financial institutions, to lend a certain percentage of total loans to SC-ST applicants. Targeted Government of India schemes such as Stand-Up India have reportedly sanctioned around 175 thousand loans to date for women and SC-ST entrepreneurs. Similarly, National SC-ST Hub supports technological upgradation and capacity building, while the Samriddhi scheme helps SC students start their own enterprises. Initiatives promoting entrepreneurship among Dalits Some of the more notable private sector initiatives for promoting entrepreneurship and innovation among SC-ST youth are run by the Dalit Indian Chamber of Commerce (DICCI), which acts as a one-stop resource centre, organising seminars, workshops, and networking meets with industry leaders. DICCI has been playing a catalyst role in implementation of Affirmative Action and Supplier Diversity, partnering with the Tata Group and Confederation of Indian Industry to organise Vendor Development Programmes across India. The Ambedkar Social Innovation Incubation Mission (ASIIM) works to promote innovation and entrepreneurship among SC students. Such examples should be replicated across the country to benefit youth in their entrepreneurial journeys. Promoting inclusivity and innovation Our suggested multi-pronged approach to promote inclusivity and innovation in entrepreneurship aims to significantly increase opportunities for marginalised youth. First, we need to inculcate a grassroots entrepreneurial culture among SC-ST youth, through Business Idea Contests, Entrepreneurship Hackathons, and Incubation Labs at District Industries Centres and Rural Self-Employment Training Institutes. Second, we need to train and equip young SC-ST students in higher-order skills such as digital technologies to drive innovation, and bridge digital divide for a level playing field. For instance, Niranjan Ovhal, an engineering graduate from SC community in Pune had started a SIM racing gear manufacturing business during Covid. His mentor convinced him to expand his business during lockdown, and today, he exports to 43 countries. Third, we must further improve access to bank finance for SC-ST entrepreneurs. Punit Kuchekar and Abhay Nale established their own robotics and automation venture in 2016-2017. They were helped to secure a working capital loan of Rs. 1 million to scale their business. Last year they achieved revenues of over Rs. 30 million, employing a team of twenty-five. SC-ST owned MSMEs We need to help SC-ST-owned MSMEs adopt ESG good practices to be able to participate in national and international supply chains. Also, mentorship plays an important role in helping first-time, grassroots entrepreneurs in establishing businesses. The success story of Panchamirtham Elumalai is an example. A school drop-out, she set up a manufacturing unit in male-dominated tools and dies field. She found support from her mentor and former electrical engineer Kunjidhapatham in streamlining business, getting customer references and servicing high-value orders. With this support, her firm grosses sales of Rs. 60 million, last year. Now she plans to expand operations globally. She hires local workers (90% are women) and has implemented strong safety protocols, runs six-hour shifts, and offers incentives for achieving productivity quotas and for their welfare. The concerted efforts by government as well as public and private sectors to capacity-build, promote innovation and democratise internet commerce can bring promising results for underprivileged entrepreneurs. Additionally, a nationwide initiative to embed mentoring into institutional frameworks which are touchpoints for SC-ST entrepreneurs can catalyse their growth. By opening doors and making resources accessible, India can embark on a path towards inclusive prosperity where no individual, regardless of their caste, is left behind.

With graduation just around the corner, Mohamed Mohamed, a senior in computer science at the University of Minnesota, has had a lot of opportunities to meet job recruiters on campus. Late last month, he also stopped in at the People of Color Career Fair at the Minneapolis Convention Center. \"It definitely stood out. There\\'s a lot of other virtual fairs and in-person career fairs. But this was specific to people of color, which made it easier to come to and easier to talk to recruiters and people doing the actual hiring,\" Mohamed told me during a break at the event. Labor has turned from abundant to scarce in Minnesota. U.S. Bancorp, the Minneapolis banking firm, last week released a survey that showed labor shortage was seen as the top risk by bank executives in the Midwest and Mid-Atlantic states. One effect is that the cottage industry of career fairs has proliferated with events that divide up and target the labor pool in new ways. Many of these events are led by people eager to help prospective workers who have historically been overlooked by employers. In addition to the People of Color event, there have been local job fairs in the past two weeks for veterans, people with physical disabilities and people who are hard of hearing or deaf. Sharon Smith-Akinsanya, founder of Rae Mackenzie Group, the Minneapolis marketing firm that runs the People of Color Career Fair, was creating such opportunities long before diversity initiatives became a craze in business circles.

Karan Brar, Kamalpreet Singh and Karanpreet Singh have been charged by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) with first degree murder and conspiracy to commit murder. With the RCMP suggesting that more arrests in the case could be coming and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau saying that “every Canadian has the fundamental right to live safely and free from discrimination and threats of violence in Canada,” a day after the arrests, it appears that tensions between the two nations are not going to ease anytime soon. In response to the arrests, External Affairs Minister (EAM) S Jaishankar has said that the events surrounding Nijjar’s death in Canada, a country in the midst of elections, are primarily tied to their domestic politics and do not involve India. Jaishankar pointed out that certain individuals supporting the Khalistani movement are manipulating Canada’s democratic system, forming a lobby, and establishing a voting bloc. He mentioned that the ruling party in Canada lacks a parliamentary majority and relies on support from pro-Khalistan figures. “We have convinced them several times not to give visa, legitimacy or political space to such people which is causing problems for them (Canada), for us and also for our relationship,” the EAM said. In September last year, Trudeau had stirred up a hornet’s nest when he alleged the “potential” involvement of Indian agents in Nijjar’s killing. The full-blown diplomatic row led to both countries expelling senior diplomats in reciprocal moves. Though India dismissed the accusation as “absurd” and “motivated,” Canada stated that it had credible intelligence shared by the “Five Eyes” network of the US, the UK, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. Months after Trudeau’s allegation, the US Justice Department indicted an Indian national for a plot to murder another Khalistani separatist Gurpatwant Singh Pannun, who holds dual citizenship of the US and Canada, on US soil. Meanwhile, an official investigation in Ottawa has reported that Indian authorities, along with representatives based in Canada, are involved in various efforts to sway Canadian communities and political figures towards supporting New Delhi’s stance on significant matters, specifically when it comes to addressing worries regarding Khalistani separatists in Canada. Commissioner Marie-Josee Hogue’s interim report revealed foreign interference in Canada’s previous federal elections in 2019 and 2021. “India does not differentiate between lawful, pro-Khalistani political advocacy and the relatively small Canada-based Khalistani violent extremism. It views anyone aligned with Khalistani separatism as a seditious threat to India,” the report said. No doubt the thriving of Khalistani supporters on Canadian soil has remained a bone of contention between both countries, but the present Indian dispensation’s foreign policy is doing more harm than good to the country. When a country is accused of sanctioning state-sponsored murder on foreign soil, it speaks volumes of that country’s diplomatic acumen, or the clear lack of it. While jingoism may garner votes to the ruling party in domestic elections, it is certainly not appreciated in foreign relations, not least, when dealing with the developed world. India’s foreign policy has been failing miserably since the last two decades. While the UPA wallowed in self pity with weak kneed responses and allowed issues to get the better of India’s interests, the BJP government on the other hand, trying to prove its muscular character, is destroying India’s image on a long-term basis which may be very difficult to redeem in the future.', 'Number of Words': 597}\n",

While campaigning at Tihu for the NDA candidate from Asom Gana Parishad (AGP), Phani Bhushan Chaudhrary and senior BJP leader Sonowal highlighted the transformative impact of Modi’s Good Government on Assam, elevating development in the region to unprecedented heights. Sonowal’s reputation for honesty, dedication, efficiency, and selflessness adds dynamism to the BJP’s campaign in Assam.

Sonowal emphasised that the BJP alliance in Assam remains unstoppable, fueled by the overwhelming response and support of the populace. Speaking at the penultimate rally before the Third Phase of elections in the country, Union Minister Sarbananda Sonowal said, “With the unwavering support from the people, our dynamic leader Narendra Modi ji is poised to assume office as Prime Minister for the third consecutive term with a massive and historic mandate. The wave of development initiated nationwide over the past decade under his resolute leadership was unimaginable a decade ago. This journey towards a developed India, exemplified by ‘Modi Ki Guarantee,’ signifies a new, robust, prosperous, and healthy India. Under the dynamic stewardship of Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi Ji, the entire nation, including the North East, has become a focal point for comprehensive development. Already ranked as the fifth-largest economy globally, India is rapidly progressing towards securing a position among the top three economies by 2030. Modi has surmounted numerous challenges, paving the way for development, transparency in governance, and empowerment at all levels of society. Over the past decade, the Modi government has redefined India’s development landscape with initiatives like the PM Awas Yojana, PM Kisan, PM Fasal Bima Yojana, PM Vishwakarma, Jan Dhan Yojana, Skill India, Make in India, Start-up India, Digital India, Ujjwala Yojana, Ayushman Bharat, Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, Jal Jeevan, and more. These efforts have ushered in a new era of transformation, cementing in the press release for immediate publication the unwavering trust and confidence of the people in the Modi administration.” Sarbananda Sonowal further said, “PM Narendra Modi ji’s commitment to the development of Northeast and Assam has been stupendous, one that has made a huge impact on the role the region plays in the national development narrative. The Modi government has tirelessly worked towards establishing lasting peace and development in Assam and the entire North-East. Modi, who instilled courage, morale, and confidence that ushered development for Assam and the North-East, is set to return for his third term as Prime Minister with a massive mandate. Under Modi’s inspiring leadership, the allocation of funds for development initiatives in the North-East has exceeded Rs 5 lakh crore. Since 2014, Modi has provided unparalleled examples of leadership and vision, reviving the pride of Assam and the entire North-East. The BJP-led NDA alliance is unstoppable, with unwavering support from the people of Assam. Modi’s visionary leadership has led to the establishment of robust medical infrastructure, AIIMS and medical colleges, health and wellness centres, and the setting up of various national institutions in Assam. With major infrastructure projects in the region, transportation within the region as well as its movement with the rest of the world have undergone a significant transformation. The people of the North-East have experienced unprecedented development and an improved quality of life under Modi’s leadership. Following Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s vision, I, along with everyone, am committed to working unitedly to secure our goal to build an Atmanirbhar Bharat and Viksit Bharat by 2047.” Concluding his remark on the popular response for the BJP-led NDA in these elections, the senior BJP leader, Sarbananda Sonowal, said, “In the past two months, the overwhelming support, cooperation, and Press Release for Immediate Publication encouragement from the people of entire Assam towards the BJP alliance have deeply touched me.

Party sources said 33 sitting MLAs of the 112 elected to the Legislative Assembly in 2019 and six MPs of the 12 who won in the last elections have been denied tickets. Among the incumbent MPs, while Dhenkanal MP Mahesh Sahoo and Nabarangpur MP Ramesh Majhi have been fielded from Hindol and Jharigam Assembly constituencies respectively, Bhartruhari Mahtab resigned from the party and got nomination from BJP in Cuttack. Political observers believe BJD has attempted to revitalise its image and appeal to a broader spectrum of voters by replacing the incumbent lawmakers. The party has been successful in poaching two disgruntled former BJP leaders, who have been fielded from two prestigious constituencies - Berhampur and Balasore. It has also reposed faith on former Congress leaders in Kendrapara, Balangir and Keonjhar constituencies.', 'Number of Words': 212}\n",

Neither the Gandhis nor the Yadavs in Uttar Pradesh have visited the temple so far. While there was speculation that the Gandhi siblings could visit the temple before the filing of nominations from Amethi and Raebareli, it did not happen. Akhilesh Yadav has turned down not one but two invitations to visit the temple – first for the January 22 inauguration and, the second, by the Uttar Pradesh speaker who led an all-party delegation on February 11. The Congress had termed the January 22 ceremony as an “event of the BJP and RSS” and said no one needed an invitation to go to a temple. Yadav, while declining it, had said he will surely visit at a later date along with his whole family. More than 100 days have passed, but neither the Gandhis nor the Yadavs have visited the temple. Modi registered this fact as he visited the temple on Sunday and also held a 2-km road show in Ayodhya late into the night. Timing of PM’s Ayodhya visit As the Uttar Pradesh election enters the crucial Awadh area in the fourth and fifth phases, the Ayodhya sentiment is expected to peak. That may explain why the prime minister was in Ayodhya for the road show ahead of polling on May 20. Amethi, Raebareli and Sultanpur are adjoining Lok Sabha seats to Ayodhya and Prime Minister Modi has already escalated his attacks on the Gandhis and the Yadavs for not visiting the temple so far, putting the opposition in a quandary over this issue. Recently, at a public rally, he took a swipe at the Congress for skipping the temple inauguration saying: “The Congress thinks it is bigger than the Lord.” He had also said INDIA bloc allies Congress and SP had insulted Ram and did not care about India’s heritage. Further, in a recent interview, he referred to the opposition saying: “You should be proud that the people who have built the Ram Mandir, those who have also struggled for it, forget all your sins. They come to your house and invite you. And they want to start anew. (But) you also reject them.” Cong leaders quit over decision to decline temple inauguration A number of Congress leaders have quit the party citing how they were hurt by the party turning down the January 22 invitation. The latest was Congress spokesperson Radhika Khera, who resigned from her primary membership on Sunday, saying she was under relentless attack inside the party as she had visited the temple in Ayodhya and said she was a devotee of Ram. Acharya Pramod Krishnan also attended the January 22 ceremony and was expelled by the Congress soon after. Other party leaders who have quit the party over this matter include spokesperson Gourav Vallabh, former union minister Suresh Pachouri and three-time MLA CJ Chavda. This begs the question why the Congress and SP have chosen not to visit the Ram temple after January 22 – the BJP is now openly questioning this, asking if this is due to vote bank politics. Both the opposition parties find themselves in a fix over this in UP.

AP McLaren’s Lando Norris won the first Formula One race of his career with a shock victory over world champion Max Verstappen in the Miami Grand Prix on Sunday. Breathing life into an F1 season that risked becoming a one-man story again, Norris, in his 110th race for McLaren, beat Verstappen by over seven seconds with Ferrari’s Charles Leclerc finishing third. Verstappen, who began on pole , had won four of the opening five races of the season and leads the world championship standings. Advertisement It looked like business as usual with the Dutchman, who had won the previous two Miami races, leading until lap 24 when he pitted and Norris’s McLaren team-mate Oscar Piastri took over the lead. Australian Piastri himself went into the pits four laps later, allowing Norris to grab the lead and the British driver never looked back. Crucially, Norris was able to pit during a safety car on lap 30, earning him a valuable time advantage which he never relinquished. The safety car came after Kevin Magnussen clipped Logan Sargeant, sending the American Williams driver into the wall, bringing a yellow flag. Norris, who had 15 podiums before his first win, took full advantage of the safety car and with Verstappen struggling to catch up, he secured his maiden victory. It was the first time Verstappen has been beaten on track, when he finished the race, since Ferrari’s Carlos Sainz won in Singapore in September last year. Norris was hoisted in the air by the McLaren mechanics as his long wait for a victory in the sport came to an end. “About time huh?” said Norris, “I knew on Friday that we had the pace…today we managed to put it together. We had the perfect strategy, it all paid off,” he added. ‘He deserves it’ Lando Norris (C) is sprayed by Max Verstappen (L) and Charles Leclerc (R) on Miami Grand Prix podium. AP “I guess a lot of people doubted me along the way. I’ve made a lot of mistakes over the last five years, my short career, but today we pulled it all together, so this is all for the team. Advertisement “I stuck with McLaren because I could believe in them and I did believe in them and today proved exactly that,” he added. The nearest Norris had come previously to winning a Grand Prix was in Sochi, Russia in 2021 when he led in the latter stages before failing to make a tyre change early in rain, costing him dearly. Verstappen, who had complained about lack of grip in qualification and during Sunday’s race, said his Red Bull had been unable to keep up with Norris once the McLaren driver switched to hard tyres. “They just had more pace, Lando was flying. It was incredibly difficult for us, but on the bad days P2, I’ll take it right? Advertisement “I’m very happy for Lando, its been a long time coming and it’s not going to be his last one. He definitely deserves it,” said the Dutchman. Leclerc echoed those sentiments. “Very often he ran very close it but for one reason or another he didn’t make it. But today he did an incredible job and the whole weekend he has been on it,” said the Ferrari driver. Sainz finished fourth with Verstappen’s Red Bull team-mate Sergio Perez in fifth place but the pair swapped places after stewards imposed a post-race penalty of five seconds on the Spaniard for his collision with Piastri. Mercedes pair Lewis Hamilton and George Russell finished sixth and eighth with RB’s Japanese driver Yuki Tsunoda ending seventh. Advertisement As in the first two years of the Miami Grand Prix, held around Hard Rock Stadium, the home of the NFL’s Miami Dolphins, the race attracted plenty of celebrities. Former France international footballer and coach Zinedine Zidane, singer Ed Sheeran, Super Bowl winning quarterback Patrick Mahomes and former US President Donald Trump were among those spotted at the race.

Earlier, candidates had the liberty to complete all questions in the defined time frame but, from now on, the students cannot shuffle between sections — marking a significant shift for aspirants. Candidates must complete each section in the allotted time before moving on to the next one. The format does not allow candidates to review or alter their responses once the time for a section has lapsed. “NBEMS has decided to introduce mandatory time-bound sections in all its Multiple Choice Questions-based examinations, such as NEET-PG, NEET-MDS, NEET-SS, FMGE, DNB-PDCET, GPAT, DPEE, FDST and FET which are conducted on a computer-based platform,” said the order. According to the order, the measure has been implemented to enhance the security and sanctity of the exams in light of emerging unfair practices during the examination process. “This technique is used to prevent the question paper from going out and then coming back as a solved paper as time available is compromised and the candidate keeps moving from segment A to E with no option of going back,” a former member of NBEMS told News18, requesting anonymity. However, he said that from a candidate’s perspective, this scheme of exam delivery is more challenging and will be detrimental to those candidates who generally keep shuffling between questions before submitting the answers. “Overall, indirectly a shift to this scheme acknowledges the imminent threat of unfair means in high-stakes examinations despite shifting over to computer-based testing,” the member said. Another expert, Dr Dhruv Chauhan, national council coordinator at Indian Medical Association’s Junior Doctors’ Network, told News18 that the new pattern of 2024 is similar to international exams like the United States Medical Licensing Examination (USMLE) and All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) exams like the Institute of National Importance Combined Entrance Test (INI-CET). However, he said the board should give enough time to students to prepare as per the new pattern. “Announcing a new pattern when the exam is less than two months away is not justified,” he added. NEET PG is scheduled to take place on June 23 this year. How does the new format work? This year, the question papers in these examinations will be divided into multiple time-bound sections. For example, in NEET-PG 2024, if there are five time-bound sections in the question paper, each section will have 40 questions and 42 minutes allotted. This means that while the number of questions and time for the exam remains the same, the exam is compartmentalised into five sections. However, details of these five compartments have not been released by NBEMS yet. Moreover, candidates will be restricted from proceeding to the next section until they complete the allotted time for the previous section. “Additionally, candidates will not be allowed to review the questions or modify their responses for a section after the completion of its allotted time. The questions for the next section will start automatically after the completion of the allotted time for the previous section,” the order read. Candidates are given the option to mark any question, whether attempted or not, for review. This means that candidates can go through these marked questions in a section again before the allotted time for that section ends. “Such mandatory time-bound sections will be implemented in GPAT 2024, NEET-PG 2024 and all forthcoming computer-based tests conducted by NBEMS.” Stay Informed With Live Updates On TN 12th Results 2024 & ICSE Results 2024 .

The ECB has all but promised a rate cut on June 6, provided incoming data strengthen policymakers\\' belief that inflation will head back to its 2 per cent target by the middle of next year. \"Both the April flash estimate for euro area inflation and the first quarter GDP number that came out improve my confidence that inflation should return to target in a timely manner,\" Lane told the newspaper in an interview. \"So, as of today, my personal confidence level has improved compared with our April meeting,\" Lane said, adding that more crucial data is still to be published in the weeks ahead. Investors also seem to think that a cut in June is all but a done deal, but doubts about subsequent moves have increased in recent weeks after the US Federal Reserve signalled that its own policy easing could be delayed. While the ECB insists it is not dependent on the Fed, a widening interest rate gap between the world\\'s biggest central banks would weaken the euro and boost European inflation, likely limiting the ECB\\'s appetite for going it alone. Lane said that April inflation data finally showed progress on services prices but the bank would continue to focus on services to make sure it did not derail disinflation later on.

Karan Brar (22), Kamalpreet Singh (22) and Karanpreet Singh (28), all Indian nationals residing in Edmonton, were charged on Friday with first-degree murder and conspiracy to commit murder. “This is important because Canada is a rule-of-law country with a strong and independent justice system, as well as a fundamental commitment to protecting all its citizens,” Trudeau said about the arrests on Saturday at a Toronto gala celebrating Sikh heritage and culture. “As the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) stated, the investigation remains ongoing, as does a separate and distinct investigation not limited to the involvement of the three persons arrested yesterday,” Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) quoted Trudeau as saying. He said many in Canada's Sikh community were feeling unsafe following Nijjar's killing, adding: “Every Canadian has the fundamental right to live safely and free from discrimination and threats of violence in Canada.” The ties between India and Canada came under severe strain following Trudeau's allegations in September last year of the “potential” involvement of Indian agents in the killing of 45-year-old Nijjar, a Khalistan separatist.\", 'Number of Words': 281}\n",

While the yacht itself looks like something out of a James Bond movie, complete with stunning features and cutting-edge tech, the internet isn't oohing and aahing. Instead, critics are slamming it as a “Climate Hypocrite's Hideaway.” Meta's CEO Mark Zuckerberg testifies during the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing at the US Capitol, in Washington, US. (Reuters) Mark Zuckerberg’s superyacht visuals go viral Mark Zuckerberg's new yacht has become a social media sensation thanks to a viral TikTok video capturing its stunning visuals. The massive vessel, currently docked in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, isn't shy about its luxury. Spanning 118 meters, the yacht made its debut sail back in March 2024 across the Atlantic and has been turning heads ever since.

The ECB has all but promised a rate cut on June 6, provided incoming data strengthen policymakers\\' belief that inflation will head back to its 2 per cent target by the middle of next year. \"Both the April flash estimate for euro area inflation and the first quarter GDP number that came out improve my confidence that inflation should return to target in a timely manner,\" Lane told the newspaper in an interview. \"So, as of today, my personal confidence level has improved compared with our April meeting,\" Lane said, adding that more crucial data is still to be published in the weeks ahead. Investors also seem to think that a cut in June is all but a done deal, but doubts about subsequent moves have increased in recent weeks after the US Federal Reserve signalled that its own policy easing could be delayed. While the ECB insists it is not dependent on the Fed, a widening interest rate gap between the world\\'s biggest central banks would weaken the euro and boost European inflation, likely limiting the ECB\\'s appetite for going it alone. Lane said that April inflation data finally showed progress on services prices but the bank would continue to focus on services to make sure it did not derail disinflation later on.

KKR qualified for the playoffs five times under Gambhir between 2011 and 2017. He also guided KKR to the final of the now-defunct Champions League T20 in 2014. However, in the last seven years, KKR could reach the Playoffs only twice. Gambhir’s return to the KKR as mentor this year turned things around. On Sunday, they moved to the top of the table with 16 points following a dominating 98-run over Lucknow Super Giants—their eighth win in 11 games. ADVERTISEMENT “This entire season we’ve been focussing on the style of cricket that Gautam Gambhir wants us to play. He has a lot of knowledge on how to turn games in our favour and it helps us in the middle. Like today, he gave the bowlers a free hand, to find their length depending on the wicket, and not to try too many things. We read the wicket well. The areas we had to bowl, we targeted the right places,” said Rana (3-24 in 3.1 overs), who played a crucial role in the win. This story has been sourced from a third party syndicated feed, agencies.

Later, the National Testing Agency (NTA) said in a public notice that an incident of ”incorrect distribution” of question papers by the centre superintendent had come to light. “In order to uphold the principles of fairness and equal opportunity for all candidates, the NTA has taken proactive measures. The examination of approximately 120 affected candidates at the centre is being conducted today, ensuring that their academic aspirations are not hindered by this incident,” said Sadhna Parashar, Senior Director, NTA.

What had been fast becoming clear now tends to be confirmed following results this week from local elections across England. There are clear current indications that the Tories are on their way out. The chances of the Labour Party capturing power ousting the Conservative Party have brightened after what is being stated as one of the worst, if not the worst, Conservative performances in local government elections in the last 40 years. It has, so far, lost over 500 council seats. Quick to understand the implications of the defeat of his party in the local body elections and byelection to one national seat, Sunak has conceded that the results were disappointing, though that is understandably a gross understatement. For, the Tories have already lost over half the council seats they were trying to defend. The upshot of the results is that the voters have stopped pinning their faith on the Conservatives. They are fed up with rising bills and the failure of the government to cushion them against the cost of living crisis. In other words, they are in a mood to punish the Conservatives who were given reasonably enough time to fix the problems. The reelection of Ben Houchen as Tees Valley mayor appears to be a poor consolation for the Conservatives and seems to be the proverbial straw that the drowning man clutches. There are other tell-tale signs that the Conservatives’ fate is sealed. The most significant of these is the Labour’s stunning victory in Blackpool which will now have Chris Webb as its MP who defeated the Conservative candidate with a 26% swing against the Tories. This is a clear message to Sunak that his time is up. The Labour also secured the newly enlarged north-east mayoralty and claimed victory in Sunak’s back yard with its candidate winning the race to be mayor of York and North Yorkshire. Labour is getting traction across England. It has wrested control of several decisive councils such as Hartlepool, Thurrock, Rushmoor and Redditch. These crucial contests show that the Labour’s stand against Brexit is getting approval from a vast swath of the population. Surely, these are essentially domestic elections, but they reflect the mood of the people who are disenchanted with the internal bickering among the Conservatives which have already installed three Prime Ministers by turn since 2019. There are now talks about yet another change of leadership to replace Sunak. But, this eventuality is doubtful despite a muted demand for it. Those among the Conservatives, who are reluctant to effect yet another change of Prime Minister with the elections due in November, argue that this would only turn the party into a laughing stock. This appears to be the dominant thinking in the party and those who are opposed to Sunak’s leadership are in the minority. But, such a tactic is no answer to the huge trust deficit of the electorate the party is facing. The Conservatives are on 25% of the projected national vote share, the lowest level since 2013. However, despite the lack of a clear-cut replacement for Sunak there is no shortage of would-be contenders. There are the critics who resigned from Sunak’s government such as Suella Braverman, who quit as Sunak’s home secretary and Robert Jenrick, who left his job as immigration minister. There are also those disgruntled elements in the form of former Home Secretary Priti Patel and some others who are still serving in Sunak’s Cabinet. These indicators prove things look bleak for the Conservative Party in the November general elections. It seems to have reached a dead end and has nothing to offer to the deeply disillusioned electorate.', 'Number of Words': 621}\n",

Deepak added that he was upset that the statement was wrongly presented. “I’d like to clarify something. I said something recently which got misconstrued. I was asked how I managed to get so many actors for the premiere scene in Pehla Nasha. I replied, ‘We were all friends. Hence, we supported each other in every way we can’. Then I said, ‘When Saif Ali Khan was getting ready, Amrita Singh asked him where he’s going. To which he said, ‘I am going to shoot for the premiere scene in Deepak’s film’. At this, Amrita replied, ‘Kya baat hai. Your generation of actors is different. We never supported one another in such a manner. Aap logon ki dosti ko manna padega,’” he told Bollywood Hungama. “This was my quote. But it was published that Amrita stopped Saif from going to the premiere. I never said that. Amrita was only amazed to see the bond between Saif and other actors. In her time, they used to not help each other. Amrita is a sweetheart and a wonderful woman. She has always been supportive of everybody as an actor. I have not worked with her. However, for us, her debut film Betaab (1983) was the ultimate film.

SRH opener Travis Head (30-ball 48, 7x4, 1x6) and Cummins (17-ball 35 not out, 2x4, 2x6) showed some spark to give the visitors some hope of a big score, for which SRH have been known for this year. Head was lucky to survive on a couple of occasions when his inside edges earned him few boundaries. He smashed debutant pacer Anshul Kamboj (1-42) for a six over the mid-wicket fence. A couple of balls later, Kamboj clean bowled Head, but the umpire declared it a no ball and Head survived. On his next ball too, Kamboj overstepped and Head capitalised on it with back-to-back fours. It was not an ideal start for the young MI pacer from Haryana. He conceded 13 runs in his first over and 19 in the second. At the time of going to press, SRH were 83-3 in nine overs. Earlier, when ace pacer Jasprit Bumrah (1-23) was introduced in the attack in the fourth over, both Head and Abhishek Sharma (11) gave him respect and managed only four singles in the over. In search of a wicket, Pandya got Bumrah to bowl his second over in the Powerplay and the pace ace didn’t disappoint his captain, dismissing opener Abhishek through wicketkeeper Ishan Kishan. At the end of the first six overs, the visitors were 56-1. Head got lucky again when pacer Nuwan Thushara (0-42) dropped him on 44 at third man off Kamboj in the eight over.

On Saturday, when an IAF convoy was on its way to Sanai Top in the Surankote area in Poonch, it came under heavy fire near the Shahsitar area. Five IAF men were injured in the attack, of whom one succumbed to his injuries. Sources in the Army intelligence said in all recent attacks, the ultras were likely aware of the movement of military vehicles. “They spray steel-coated bullets on trucks, which makes it nearly impossible to escape unhurt. The terrorists are well trained in ambushes. They know the positions they have to take during the attack. Even in Saturday's attack, bullets were fired from at least three different directions,” said a source. The strategy of “hit and run” by terrorists where they open indiscriminate firing on military vehicles and escape into deep forest area before the reinforcements come has turned the attention of Army commanders towards this new technique. However, despite multiple ambushes in the past one year, the forces have not been able to devise a strategy to prevent these. The incidents have also raised questions on the security scenario in the region and failure of intelligence. After last year's April 20 ambush near Bhimber Gali, five Army commandos lost their lives in the Rajouri's Kandi area on May 5 when terrorists triggered an explosion as the soldiers reached near them.

The chatbot can be accessed by X Premium and Premium+ users and was said to have a \"sense of humour\" at the time of its launch. advertisement And now, Musk\\'s is rolling out a new feature powered by Grok AI. However, this feature is only available for premium users of X. The feature seems to be aimed at enhancing the way users interact with trending stories. Announced through their official X engineering team account, @XEng, the platform will now provide premium subscribers with an AI-generated summary of posts linked to each trending topic. These summaries will be easily accessible under the ‘For You’ tab in the ‘Explore’ section. \" Now available: Stories on X, powered by Grok AI. See what the world is talking about with Stories on X, curated by @grok. Now available for Premium subscribers in the Explore tab! web & iOS only for now-- let us know your feedback,\" the post read. The \\'For You\\' page is designed to offer a personalised experience, displaying stories and news items that align with the user’s interests. This feature aims to keep users well-informed and engaged by providing them with a synopsis of the latest news on X. Unlike traditional methods that might simply show text from the original articles, these summaries will dynamically integrate insights from discussions and conversations happening across the platform, thus offering a fresh perspective on trending subjects. However, the platform acknowledges that its AI tool, named Grok, isn\\'t flawless and may occasionally produce errors. To address this, following each summary, users will see a warning: \"Grok can make mistakes, verify its outputs.\" This cautionary note encourages users to assess the information provided critically. While the idea of summarising trending news is already familiar to social media users, X’s approach is distinctively modern. Under the leadership of former CEO Jack Dorsey, Twitter had introduced a somewhat similar feature where ongoing trends were summarised manually rather than by AI, providing context through curated tweets and pins. In addition to this, X has introduced a number of new features in the last few months. One of these is the addition of Community Notes in India. The feature lets users fact-check information being circulated on the platform before believing it to be true. Announcing the Community Notes feature, X\\'s post on the social media platform read, \"Welcome new contributors in India. Our first contributors are joining today, and we’ll be expanding over time. As always, we’ll monitor quality to ensure that notes are found helpful by people from different points of view. Community Notes now has contributors in 69 countries around the world, and we’re adding more regularly.\"', 'Number of Words': 530}\n",

Pic/AFP Listen to this article ‘We can beat anybody’ x 00:00 Delhi Capitals (DC) face a must-win situation in their remaining three games to stay in the hunt for a play-off berth, but head coach Ricky Ponting is confident that if Rishabh Pant and Co can play their best cricket for 40 overs, they will be hard to beat. DC have been inconsistent so far, winning five and losing six of their last 11 games. ADVERTISEMENT Ricky Ponting While winning the remaining three games is a must for DC, even that will only take them to 16 points which might not be enough to qualify for the last four stage. “Our last performance against Kolkata wasn’t one of our best, but we’re back home now. We’ve won two of our three games here,” Ponting said on the eve of their match against Rajasthan Royals (RR) here. “We know we’re coming up against a very good Rajasthan side, but as we’ve seen in the tournament so far if we can play our best cricket for 40 overs, then I’ll guarantee that we’ll be hard to beat. It doesn’t matter who we play or where we play them. We know that we can beat anybody. “We are keeping an eye on things. We find ourselves in a situation where we most likely have to win our last three games to qualify. We had a slow start, but really proud of what the boys have done in the last 6-7 games,” he added.

After an almost 18-month hiatus, Apple is finally set to release a major refresh to its iPad lineup on May 7, 2024, in an online event dubbed \\'Let Loose.\\' Apple\\'s Chief Executive Officer, Tim Cook, is reportedly set to lead the online presentation, which is expected to last around 30 minutes. The event is the first big event Apple is hosting this year and is anticipated to bring significant upgrades to the iPad Pro and iPad Air, along with potential updates to their accessories. Here is everything we expect from the Let Loose event happening tomorrow. advertisement iPad Pro to get better with OLED Screens The biggest highlight of the event is said to be the introduction of OLED screens for the iPad Pro. According to Bloomberg\\'s Mark Gurman, Apple will upgrade the screens of the iPad Pro to provide richer visuals with improved brightness, contrast, and colour accuracy, making the iPad Pro even more powerful for creative professionals and media enthusiasts. Thinner design and potential M4 Chip The new iPad Pro models are also expected to be significantly thinner compared to their predecessors, with the 12.9-inch model potentially shrinking by 20% and the 11-inch model by 15%. This sleek design might be partially attributed to the adoption of OLED displays, but battery life remains a potential concern. Rumours also suggest that Apple is set to debut its new generation faster M4 chip with the iPad Pro lineup, offering significant performance and efficiency improvements over the current M3 chip. This could further solidify the iPad Pro\\'s position as a powerful productivity and creative powerhouse. However, for Macs, Apple is expected to refresh the lineup later in the year. Redesigned Front Camera Similar to the base iPad, the iPad Pro is expected to relocate its front-facing camera to the landscape bezel. This change aims to provide a more natural and intuitive experience during video conferencing. New Magic Keyboard Apple might also unveil a redesigned Magic Keyboard specifically for the new iPad Pro models. This iteration could feature an aluminium base for a more laptop-like feel, a larger trackpad, and possibly even a row of function keys, further boosting productivity and usability. New Apple Pencil 3 The long-awaited third-generation Apple Pencil is also rumoured to debut tomorrow, featuring upgrades such as swappable tips, Find My integration, and a potential \"squeeze\" gesture for additional control options. This could cater to a wider range of creative needs and workflows. And a big price hike With significant upgrades and potentially a new chip, price increases for the new iPad Pro models are also likely. Reports suggest that base prices could rise by at least $100, and when factoring in the potential need for a new Magic Keyboard and Apple Pencil, the overall cost of a complete iPad Pro package might see a significant jump. iPad Air to get bigger and better While the iPad Pro takes centre stage with its OLED revolution, Apple is also expected to update the iPad Air lineup. The most notable addition will be a 12.9-inch iPad Air, marking the first time this larger size enters the Air category. However, this model is likely to retain the LCD display technology of previous Air models. Similar to the iPad Pro, the front-facing camera will be repositioned to the landscape bezel. No Magic Keyboard for iPad Air advertisement Despite the upgrades, the redesigned Magic Keyboard will reportedly remain exclusive to the iPad Pro models, potentially maintaining a clear distinction between the two iPad tiers. iPadOS 17.5 release date and more Apple might also announce the release date for iPadOS 17.5. While major feature additions might be limited, expect information on Find My security enhancements and the potential addition of new games and apps. However, a more comprehensive OS update, potentially iPadOS 18, alongside iOS 18 and other updates, might be unveiled at Apple\\'s WWDC event scheduled for a month later.', 'Number of Words': 652}\n",

This isn’t the first time that Kramnik has raised suspicions of cheating against other players. In the past, the 48-year-old Russian has accused American Hikaru Nakamura of cheating in blitz. Following Kramnik’s allegations against multiple players in the past, Chess.com – a chess server that also functions as a social networking platform for chess players – shut down his blog and muted his account. Kramnik claims that Sarin’s results against the top-10 players are ‘99.9999% impossible’ even though he didn’t explicitly named the Indian. “Justification is that it is mathematically 99.9999% impossible. If you and other people commenting here don’t bother your opinions match mathematical FACTS, it is not my problem, but yours gentlemen. And you even dare “shaming” me for being adequate and sane, sticking to REALITY,” read Kramnik’s response to a post contesting his claims against the 19-year-old Sarin.

I can sponsor the prize fund on the condition that the winner gets 100% of the prize money,” Banjan wrote.

This time even a much inferior performance like 7 points out of 9 would convince me and surely the rest of the public,” Kramnik wrote. I cant understand what it has to do with me since the historical result was shown against other,much stronger players, so would be more logical to organize a match with GM Firouzja, for examle. I am sure Alireza would try at least scoring some points after 9 losses in a row 👇— Vladimir Kramnik (@VBkramnik) May 4, 2024 In an interview to Hindustan Times, Banjan dismissed Kramnik’s claims as ‘delusional’. “We have nothing but respect for Kramnik but his comments are delusional. Him not being accountable for his insinuations causes more damage than he realises, both to him and chess. Nihal has a career to build and a good 20-25 years in front of him. Also, Nihal plays most of his online games from India where the speed of servers is considerably lower than say Europe. So, his numbers are despite the handicap,” Banjan said. In 2018, aged 14, Sarin became the then third youngest player in history to pass the Elo rating of 2600.', 'Number of Words': 556}\n",

Mental strength is what you need to survive and play to your ability. There are many players who play under real stress.” He says emotional and mental quotient plays big time. “Due to the pandemic and bio bubble, we as a coach have become more aware of our role outside the coaching and mentoring, making sure we communicate with the players. In India, one of the big inhabiting factors is that they have such a respect for coachers which is amazing, but it can be a deterrent as a young player will not voice an opinion due to respect.

Netanyahu has said he is open to a deal that would pause nearly seven months of fighting and bring home hostages held by Hamas. But he also says he remains committed to an invasion of the southern Gaza city of Rafah, despite widespread international opposition because of the more than 1 million civilians huddled there. “I say to the leaders of the world: No amount of pressure, no decision by any international forum will stop Israel from defending itself,” he said, speaking in English. “Never again is now.”', 'Number of Words': 171}\n",

While Johar refrained from explicitly mentioning the channel or the comedian’s name, he criticised the act, labeling it as being in “poor taste.” Karan’s Instagram post conveyed his disappointment at stumbling upon Singh’s mimicry act while watching television with his mother. He lamented the lack of respect from within the industry and expressed sadness rather than anger at the situation. He wrote, “I was sitting and watching television with my mom… and saw a promo of a reality comedy show on a supposedly respectable channel… a comic was mimicking me in exceptionally poor taste… I expect this from trolls and faceless and nameless people but when your own industry can disrespect someone who has been in the business for over 25 years it speaks volumes about the times we live in… this doesn’t even anger me it just makes me sad!” Advertisement In response to Johar’s sentiments, Kettan Singh issued a heartfelt apology to the filmmaker. In an interview with Times Now, Singh expressed remorse, stating, “I would like to apologise to Karan (Johar) sir. First of all, whatever impersonation I do because I watch a lot of Karan Johar on the coffee show, I am a fan of his work. I have seen his latest film, Rocky Aur Rani Kii Prem Kahaani 5 to 6 times. I am a huge fan of his work and his show. If my actions hurt him, I would like to apologise to him. My intention was not to hurt him. I just wanted to entertain audience but if I did something extra, I would like to say sorry to him.” Acknowledging Johar’s reaction to the promo, Singh admitted to not having seen the full episode and expressed his desire to gauge the reactions of both the audience and Johar post-viewing. He said, “I haven’t watched the episode. Sir has reacted to the promo. I haven’t seen the episode. I would like to see the reactions of people and Karan sir after watching the episode. I don’t want to offend, sir. Many artists don’t mimic Karan sir. I used to do it a couple of years ago on The Kapil Sharma Show. I did it for the first time on Madness Machayenge.

Prasad is personally monitoring the exercise. Distribution of voter slips is an important and challenging task in the election process. Once the slip is personally delivered to the voter, he is not required to search in the voter list. Once he reaches the polling station , he can directly exercise his franchise.In Mumbai also, both the collectors - Sanjay Yadav (Mumbai city) and Rajendra Kshirsagar (Mumbai suburban) have launched a massive drive for the distribution of voter slips across the city. South Mumbai returning officer Ravi Katakdhond says that special efforts are being made to ensure that voter slips are delivered to the people well in advance so that no inconvenience is caused to them while voting. Besides, in the recent past, several awareness events were undertaken to ensure that there is maximum participation in the voting process. Katakdhond says his office has undertaken a special drive to identify people above the age of 85 who may not be able to participate in the voting process and special arrangements have been made for them so that they can vote from home. All this is to ensure that there is a considerable increase in voting percentage.Veteran bureaucrat Mahesh Zagde has set an example not only for the bureaucracy and IPS fraternity but the entire society when it comes to expenditure on marriages. A week ago when his younger daughter Oma, got married, it was an entirely private event.

Elgar, who was reportedly forced into retirement by red-ball coach Shukri Conrad since the senior opener wasn\\'t in his future plans for Proteas, in a revelation has spoken about his captaincy stint, the sudden removal and the premature retirement saying that his hard work wasn\\'t recognised. Elgar in a conversation with Rapport Newspaper mentioned that he wasn\\'t aware of what he was getting into as cricket took a backseat when he was named the skipper and he became a full-time politician and an administrator. \"I became a part-time cricketer and full-time politician, something that I never want to go through again,\" Elgar said. \"I am a sportsman, not a politician or a cricket administrator, but I was thrown into a cauldron in which I had to be all three. If I had known that before, I would never have accepted the captaincy.\" Elgar felt backstabbed by the Cricket South Africa (CSA) after he was sacked from the top job. It was on the horizon after South Africa lost to Australia 3-0, however, under Elgar, South Africa had a more than a decent shot at qualifying for the World Test Championship (WTC) final after beating India, Bangladesh and West Indies. “It felt as though they did not recognise all my hard work over the previous year-and-a-half, that they didn’t realise how much we had improved as a team,\" Elgar added. \"From being sixth or seventh in the world we became a team with the potential to play in the World Test Championship final.\" Elgar mentioned that the new red-ball coach was better aligned with Temba Bavuma as the skipper. Even though there was no bad blood with Bavuma, Elgar didn\\'t hold himself back on blaming Conrad. \"Shukri Conrad is the reason why my Test career was cut short,” said Elgar who admittedly held himself back from criticizing his earswhile employees with the contract still being on till the end of April. Elgar retired from international cricket on a high as a captain after Bavuma was injured for the second Test against India. Even though the Proteas lost the second Test in Cape Town, his 185 in the opener in Centurion was the main reason why the hosts could draw the series 1-1.

The national party alleged the Bharatiya Janata Party\\'s (BJP) involvement in the incident. In a statement on microblogging platform X (formerly Twitter), the Congress accused Smriti Irani and BJP supporters of \\'being scared\\' ahead of the upcoming polling in Amethi. \"Smriti Irani and BJP workers are badly scared in Amethi, UP. Frustrated by the defeat they saw, BJP goons armed with sticks and rods reached outside the Congress office in Amethi and vandalised vehicles parked there. There has been a deadly attack on Congress workers and people of Amethi. Many people are badly injured in this attack. During the incident, vehicles of local people were also damaged. The police administration remained a mute spectator during the entire incident. This incident is a witness that BJP is going to lose badly in Amethi,\" the party wrote in a post. The miscreants reportedly fled after creating a ruckus, triggering a protest by party workers. Congress District President Pradeep Singal rushed to the party office soon after the incident, and a heavy police force also reached there and tried to pacify the protesting party workers, according to reports. The police said they would investigate and take action against those responsible for the incident. Elections are being held in all seven phases in Uttar Pradesh, which contributes the largest number of seats (80) to the Lower House. 16 seats were contested in the initial two phases. Meanwhile Amethi will go to polls on May 20 in the fifth phase of the Lok Sabha elections. Congress spokesperson Supriya Shrinate accused the police of remaining inactive while BJP supporters engaged in unruly behaviour. \"Vehicles parked outside the Congress office in Amethi were vandalised. The police remained a silent spectator and the BJP workers continued with their hooliganism. The wind has changed, breaking vehicles will not solve the problem, BJP people!,\" she said. Smriti Irani vs KL Sharma in Amethi In the electoral context, Smriti Irani\\'s victory over Rahul Gandhi in Amethi by a margin of 55,000 votes in the previous election marked the end of the Gandhi family\\'s long-standing dominance in the constituency. Between 2014 and 2019, Congress\\'s representation in Uttar Pradesh decreased from two seats to one, with Amethi being lost in the process. In the current election cycle, Rahul Gandhi aims to defend the sole remaining seat held by his family in the state in Raebareli, while long-time party loyalist Kishori Lal Sharma will take on Smriti Irani. Who is Kishori Lal Sharma, Congress\\' Amethi candidate? Kishori Lal Sharma, closely associated with the Gandhi family, was nominated for the Amethi Lok Sabha constituency by the Congress on Friday. His candidacy coincides with Rahul Gandhi\\'s nomination filing from Raebareli on Friday, the traditional Congress stronghold. The Gandhi family\\'s influence in Amethi has waned since Rahul Gandhi\\'s defeat in 2019, prompting Sharma\\'s candidacy as an effort to regain a foothold in the region. The last non-Gandhi Congress candidate in Amethi was Satish Sharma, who secured victory twice following the seat\\'s vacancy after the assassination of former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi. Satish Sharma\\'s tenure ended in defeat in 1998, after which the Gandhis reclaimed control of Amethi from 1999 onward.', 'Number of Words': 585}\n",

She has so far been concentrating on small gatherings and roadshows, where people first try to get a glimpse of her from close quarters and then potentially get clicked with the “Queen” star. Selfies and group photos with the actor, who has been fielded by the BJP from the Mandi Lok Sabha seat, are in vogue as it is the first time a celebrity is contesting elections in Himachal Pradesh. Videos of Ranaut, who hails from Mandi, dancing with local women and sweeping temple premises during her campaign have gone viral. To forge an instant connect, she often interacts with her prospective voters in their dialects and emphasises that she a daughter of Mandi. Known for her unfiltered remarks, Ranaut has given some media bites but not yet offered them an interaction involving questions and answers. BJP leaders say her typical campaign day starts with paying obeisance at the temples of local deities. She focuses on the women voters, who comprise about 49 per cent of the total voters of the state, and the youth. She has said she would ensure women and men are “equal in all spheres”. Ranaut–who often voiced pro-BJP opinions even before she joined the party and was fielded from Mandi–bashes Congress leaders for their alleged anti-women remarks and talks derisively about dynastic politics. At a recent poll rally in Manali, which falls under the Mandi Parliament seat, Ranaut indirectly attacked Congress leaders Rahul Gandhi and Vikramaditya Singh by saying there is one “Bada Pappu” in Delhi and a “Chhota Pappu” here. Himachal Pradesh's Public Works Minister Vikramaditya Singh, a scion of the erstwhile Rampur estate, is her challenger from the Mandi Parliament seat. He is son of six-time chief minister late Virbhadra Singh and the current state Congress president Pratibha Singh. Ranaut often uses the term “Shezada” to attack Vikramaditya Singh and takes digs at him by repeatedly asserting that, unlike him, she is not in politics because of her father or mother. She has said Prime Minister Narendra Modi is an “ansh” of Lord Ram and Vishnu and claims that she would work like people's postwoman, taking their issues and problems to New Delhi. But some people, like Mahesh who is a senior citizen from Sundernagar, feel that Ranaut's personal attacks and snide remarks against her rivals might not go down well with voters in Himachal Pradesh even though they might be getting cheers from the crowd. “Such kinds of politics and insulting remarks do not resonate with people in Dev Bhoomi Himachal,” Mahesh said. The Mandi Parliament seat comprises 17 assembly seats, eight are reserved for Schedule Tribe and Schedule caste. These seats include Chamba district's three tribal assembly constituencies — Kinnaur, Lahaul and Spiti and Bharmour; Kullu district's all four assembly segments — Kullu, Manali, Banjar and Anni; Mandi district's nine assembly constituencies — Sundernagar, Balh, Mandi, Darang, Jogindernagar, Nachan, Seraj, Karsog and Sarkaghat; and Rampur in Shimla district.\", 'Number of Words': 539}\n",

HT Image Along with honoring winners and finalists in 15 journalism categories, the Pulitzer Board also recognizes distinguished work in areas including books, music and theater. The awards, which will honor work from 2023, are scheduled to be announced via livestream at 3 p.m. Eastern time. Unlock exclusive access to the latest news on India's general elections, only on the HT App. Download Now! Download Now! While forecasting potential winners is a guessing game, the Pulitzers often go to coverage of the year's biggest stories. In this case, the Oct. 7 attack on Israel and subsequent war in Gaza is a possibility and may engender controversy. With the Committee to Protect Journalists estimating at least 97 journalists and media workers have been killed in Gaza, many observers will be interested to see if the Pulitzers recognize work by Palestinian reporters. Last month a group of journalism professors called on The New York Times to address questions about an investigation into gender-based violence during the Hamas attack on Israel. The prizes are administered by Columbia University in New York, which itself has been in the news for student demonstrations against the war in Gaza. The Pulitzer board met away from Columbia this past weekend to deliberate on its winners. The board issued a statement Thursday saluting student journalists at Columbia and other universities across the country for their work covering the campus demonstrations. For the first time, the Pulitzers opened eligibility to broadcast and audio companies that also operate digital news sites, such as CNN, NPR and the broadcast networks ABC, CBS and NBC. The work must be primarily in digital journalism, however. The Columbia Journalism School also administers the duPont-Columbia Awards, which recognize audio and visual journalism and are presented in the winter. The Pulitzers give out cash awards and a medal for its prestigious public service prize, won last year by The Associated Press for its coverage of the Russian siege of Mariupol in Ukraine. The Pulitzers also announced that five of the 45 finalists this year used artificial intelligence in research and reporting of their submissions. It was the first time the board required applicants for the award to disclose use of AI. The prizes were established in the will of newspaper publisher Joseph Pulitzer and first awarded in 1917.

Abhijit Gangopadhyay Joins BJP: Former Calcutta High Court Judge Joins BJP Two Days After Resigning From Post (Watch Video) The root of the complaint was a procession by BJP supporters at Tamluk while Gangopadhyay was going to file his nomination as a candidate on May 4. Tension started as the procession passed through the area where some dismissed school staff were holding demonstrations against the Calcutta High Court order. According to Maidul Islam, President of the West Bengal Primary Teachers’ Association - which is considered close to the Trinamool, there was an unprovoked attack on the protestors by members of Gangopadhyay\\'s procession. He also cautioned that if those involved in the attack on the hunger strike are not quickly arrested, there will be a larger agitation across the state. Abhijit Gangopadhyay Resigns: Mixed Reactions in Trinamool Congress, West Bengal Opposition Parties to Calcutta High Court’s Justice Announcement Reacting to the FIR, Gangopadhyay said that such FIRs based on fake allegations are quite common and he is ready to face its outcome. \"I want to see how long those who are resorting to such fake allegations can escape the clutches of law,\" he added.

The bridge, which will span the Brahmaputra River, is set to connect Dhubri in Assam with Phulwari in Meghalaya, reducing travel time and easing trade and communication between the two states. The 20-kilometre-long bridge, expected to be completed by 2027, has become a critical issue in the triangular electoral contest involving the All India United Democratic Front (AIUDF), the Assam Gana Parishad (AGP), and the Congress party. The foundation stone for the bridge was laid in 2021, with Prime Minister Narendra Modi officiating the ceremony. Also Read | West Bengal: FIR Filed Against Former Calcutta High Court Judge-Turned-BJP Candidate Abhijit Gangopadhyay for Attacking School Employees. Residents, including students, businessmen, and everyday commuters, have expressed enthusiasm for the bridge, citing the challenges posed by the current boat transportation system. Presently, travelling across the Brahmaputra by boat can take three to four hours, with significant disruptions during the monsoon season. The new bridge is expected to cut the travel distance between Dhubri and Phulwari by around 200 kilometres, streamlining trade and other essential activities. A resident said, \"If the bridge gets built, the benefit will be that we can reach Meghalaya in a much shorter time. It will make things easier for businesses since transporting goods on boats is very challenging. With the bridge, it will be much easier. It takes three hours by boat, so this bridge will save a lot of time.\" Also Read | Pune: Hit by Ball on Private Parts, Teenage Boy Collapses and Dies While Playing Cricket at Sports Academy Ground in Lohegaon. A student also shared his reviews, stating, \"Once the bridge is completed, it will help us in a lot of ways, like in coordination because it takes a long time to travel by boat, approximately 3 hours. Also, it\\'s a huge river, which is dangerous too. Dhubri and Meghalaya, both states, will benefit from this bridge.\" The bridge\\'s significance has become a central theme in the electoral campaigns of the three competing parties. Each party claims credit for initiating or championing the project, with differing narratives on its origins. Javed Islam of the AGP, an ally of the National Democratic Alliance (NDA), emphasised the role of the current central government, stating, \"The NDA government started the work of this bridge. In 2021, Prime Minister Modi laid the foundation of this bridge, and the construction is progressing rapidly. It will be a significant gift for the people of Assam.\" Badruddin Ajmal, the AIUDF president and a three-time MP from Dhubri, asserted that the bridge was a result of his efforts, claiming, \"I had raised this issue in Parliament during the Congress government and then during the BJP government, ensuring the people of Assam received this gift.\" The Congress party has also highlighted its contributions, mentioning the bridge in its campaign rallies to secure credit. Despite the political debate, the consensus among locals is that the bridge is essential and will significantly improve their quality of life. While the competing narratives continue to unfold as election day approaches, the Dhubri Phulwari Bridge remains a beacon of hope for the people of Assam and Meghalaya, symbolising progress and connectivity in the region.

Sunil Narine hugs Andre Rusell in celebration for the wicket of Nicholas Pooran in the IPL 2024 clash between KKR and LSG on Sunday. (Photo – PTI) New Delhi: Sunil Narine, who has been in some form for Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) in the Indian Premier League (IPL) 2024, yet again starred for his side delivering an all-round performance but his 81-run knock claiming all the spotlight. He levelled compatriot Andre Russell for a huge KKR record “post-match”. KKR as visitors, thrashed Lucknow Super Giants (LSG) by 98 runs at the Ekana Cricket Stadium in Lucknow, toppling Rajasthan Royals (RR) to reign the points table. Southpaw Narine has been hitting the ball quite well lately and has almost turned his role as a full-time opener. He took a mere 36 deliveries, sending six of them for fours and plundered seven sixes. His strike rate soared at 207.69 as he helped KKR post a mammoth 235-run total on the scoreboard after being invited to bat first by LSG. Other KKR batters decently contributed to their cause but in a quick manner as Phil Salt’s strike rate stood at 228.57 while Ramandeep Singh’s 6-ball 25* brought a strike rate of above 400. Nonetheless, Narine’s ferocious 81-run knock headlined the clash as LSG were bundled out at 137 in just 16.1 overs, courtesy of KKR bowlers like Harshit Rana, Varun Chakravarthy, and Andre Russell. Rana and Chakravarthy bagged three wickets apiece while Russell picked two to power KKR to an early win. 35-year-old Sunil Narine was adjudged the Player of the Match for his heroics in the game as he picked up a wicket as well. It was the 15th PoTM award for the allrounder as he equalled Russell who also boasts 15 PoTM awards for KKR. Most PoTM awards for KKR in IPL 15 – Andre Russell 15 – Sunil Narine 10 – Gautam Gambhir 7 – Yusuf Pathan Varun making my job easier – Narine The win margin was KKR’s third biggest in terms of runs while it was the biggest defeat margin for LSG in IPL so far. After being handed the PoTM trophy, Narine said it’s important to start well in the game having to pick strengths and spots that sometimes work out and sometimes don’t. He went on to praise Varun Chakravarthy who is supposedly making his job easier to keep things tight by picking up wickets. “He is a hard worker and it’s good to see him do well,” Narine said.

According to information, a ladden truck heading from Tezpur side to Biswanath Chariali swerved down to the river side where the huge rallings of the concrete bridge were placed and hit with brute force. It is to be mention here due to slow pace of four-lane road construction from Jamugurihat to Gohpur many road accidents have taken place and many people have lost their valuable lives. Road accidents have become a common phenomenon at Jamugurihat, Sootea and Biswanath Chariali area at present. The construction work of the four-lane road ended at the western end of the Ghiladhari river and the commuting vehicles have to cross the river from a single concrete bridge. No distinct road sign and diversion signs have been installed in both ends of the bridge. The new driver who passes through the road doesn't even know that the road has ended and have to cross the river through a single lane. Due to the negligence of the construction company, frequent road accidents take place in this area. The local people have urged the local administration to take up the issue as early as possible.

Parsis built some of the finest business empires while contributing to Indian economy over last 70 years. Pure grace and business acumen, runs in their families i guess,\" another user commented. Godrej\\'s succession plans The Godrej family has revealed its succession plan after the split. Adi Godrej and brother Nadir Godrej will keep the stock exchange listed companies. Pirojsha Godrej, son of patriarch Adi Godrej, will take over as chairman of the Godrej Industries Group in August 2026. Currently, the 43-year-old is the executive chairperson of Godrej Properties, Godrej Fund Management, and Godrej Housing Finance, and a non-executive director of Godrej Consumer Products and Godrej Agrovet. Nyrika Holkar, daughter of Smita Godrej Crishna will be the face of Godrej Enterprises Group; Nadir Godrej will be the chairperson of Godrej Industries Group (GIG), Godrej Seeds and Genetics, Innovia Multiventures, and all their subsidiaries and joint ventures, according to a Business Standard report. The next generation of the multibillionaire families joined the firm as well, taking on important leadership roles in its companies. Nisaba Godrej, the daughter of Adi Godrej, is the executive chairman of Godrej Consumer Products. The eldest child and Adi\\'s older daughter, Tanya Dubash, serves as executive director of Godrej Industries, the Adi/Nadir family\\'s main company. She also leads the group\\'s brand. On the other hand, Jamshyd will now become the chairperson and managing director of Godrej Enterprises Group and Nyrika Holkar will be its executive director. Smita\\'s daughter, Freyan Crishna Bieri is a non-executive director of Godrej & Boyce and Jamshyd\\'s son, Navroze Godrej is a non-executive director of the unlisted company with large tracts of land in Mumbai. Godrej split Last week, the family behind the Godrej brand declared a split of assets into two business groups. Soaps and suds on one side, locks and fridges on the other would be the retail-level view of it. The Godrej Industries Group (GIG) of brothers Adi and Nadir Godrej will house listed firms Godrej Industries, Godrej Consumer Products, Godrej Properties, Godrej Agrovet and Astec Lifesciences, while the Godrej Enterprises Group (GEG) of their cousins Jamshyd Godrej and Smita Crishna will have the unlisted Godrej & Boyce, which has over a dozen divisions, as its flag-bearer. The family agreement includes a deal not to compete among themselves for six years, except in real estate. After that, they can venture into each other’s markets, but not under the Godrej brand. The pact also stated that GIG has exclusive rights to it in sectors of proven success such as fast moving consumer goods (like soap), financial services, pharma, diagnostics and chemicals, while GEG has that privilege in defence, consumer durables (like ACs and fridges), medical devices, construction materials, interior design, electric mobility, software services and security products (like locks and safes). In real estate, both plan to work in alliance, possibly with GIG as property marketer and GEG as land developer, as they’ve done under an earlier agreement that’s said to have held steady.

There are anti-corruption and vigilance agencies both at the Central and the State levels with mandate to identify and punish those indulging in corrupt practices irrespective of status and influence, political affiliation, money & muscle power etc. and the parties in the governments. So, why wait five years to punish the corrupt forces unmasked by the NDA government? Punish them immediately as per law and the crime committed without giving any scope to them for destroying evidence. The above statement raises doubt whether those corrupt people would not be punished if NDA government is not reelected to power at the Centre. Dr O Prasada Rao, Hyderabad Quid pro quo behind medicine price surge? We are the world’s largest democracy. We must preserve what our freedom fighters like Bhagat Singh, Netaji Subas Chandra Bose and Mahatma Gandhi fought for. Let’s not lose this legacy for a power-hungry politician. It is very important that we, the people of India, wake up and take action before it’s too late. If you compare the prices of medicines you bought eight months ago with the current prices, you will be shocked to find that the prices of medicines have gone up to 100 per cent. Why did these pharmaceutical companies suddenly raise the price of medicines so much? The answer is electoral bond. Several pharma companies had to pay crores of rupees to the BJP government as forced bribes through electoral bonds. In order to recover this money, the companies had no alternative but to increase the price of medicines without any control. The government allowed these companies to increase the prices of even essential medicines. If this is not corruption, what is? Jubel D’Cruz, Mumbai Modi cannot speak without ‘Muslims, Pak’ This time round Prime Minister Narendra Modi seems to excel himself at lowering the standards of political discourse. His campaign rhetoric mostly revolves around ‘M’ and ‘P’. How the incendiary words he speaks verbalising and spreading viciousness come out is completely beyond comprehension. In his lexicon, synonyms for Muslims are ‘infiltrators’ and ‘those who have more children’. The relevance of his saying at this point in time that RJD chief Lalu Prasad Yadav tried ‘to save those responsible for the Godhra incident’ is not clear. His revelation that ‘Pakistani leaders are praying to make Shehzada the Prime Minister’ was his way of playing the ‘P’ card. Shehzada is a term of endearment that Narendra Modi uses to refer to Rahul Gandhi. We wish he shared with the public the source of this information. We, people of different faiths, live cheek by jowl. But in Modi we have a candidate who does not adhere to this general norm. G David Milton, Maruthancode, TN Bar tainted politicians from contesting Karnataka’s former minister and JD(S) MLA Revanna is reported to have been arrested by the SIT in an abduction case of women. His son Prajwal Revanna and Hassan JD(S) candidate, who is on the run, is an accused of sexual assault on several women and faces arrest when he comes back to the country. In Sandeshkali, too, the local MLA was arrested on the charges of molesting more women in his constituency. Atrocities on women by the elected representatives is a cause for concern. It is a shame that we do have such atrocious representatives. Law should take its own course and the guilty punished severely irrespective of their position. Persons with criminal background should also be barred from contesting elections besides their property confiscated. Sravana Ramachandran, Chennai MIM can’t take Hyd win for granted BJP’s nominee for contest in Hyderabad parliamentary elections Madhavi Lata seems to be a very knowledgeable and also an aggressively mature contestant for the seat. Undoubtedly, there is a printed conclusion in the minds of all political parties for the past several decades that Hyderabad is an easy victory for the AIMIM party without any problem. But, the present vigorous canvassings by the BJP candidate in every nook and corner of the Old City do indicate that the voters are now reviewing the situation afresh after listening to her meetings face to face and also through the several electronic media that the party is promoting. I think this is the first open fight between the BJP and the AIMIM unlike earlier elections where each party took it for granted and supported each other. Hopefully, the present candidate with her immense knowledge, ambition and maturity shall succeed politically. Katuru Durga Prasad Rao, Hyderabad', 'Number of Words': 781}\n",

They’ve effectively closed the southern Red Sea to most Western ships, forcing them to avoid the Suez Canal and instead go around southern Africa when traveling between Asia and Europe.That’s adding days and plenty in the way of fuel and freight costs onto journeys.The American and British airstrikes have degraded the Houthis’ capabilities, but they’re still able to target ships. Shipping and freight executives increasingly think the Red Sea will remain too dangerous for many more months, if not the rest of the year.The Houthis receive military training and intelligence and radar support from Iran, which is crucial when targeting moving objects such as ships.While the Houthis have started to attack vessels further away from Yemen, including one in the Arabian sea about 600 kilometers from the country last week, almost all their successful strikes have been over shorter distances.', 'Number of Words': 298}\n",

However, speedster Harshal Patel feels they are still in the race for the playoff spots. After electing to bowl, Punjab restricted CSK to 167/9 thanks to superb spells by Rahul Chahar and Harshal Patel at the Himachal Pradesh Cricket Association (HPCA) Stadium here.

While the leg-spinner recorded figures of 3-23 in his 4 overs at an economy rate of 5.8, Harshal gave away just 24 runs and picked 3 wickets as well in his 4 overs, maintaining an economy rate of 6. But despite the spectacular bowling performance, Punjab fell short of the target and was unable to get their third win in a row. Despite the result, Harshal maintained that the side still had a chance of making it to the playoffs. PBKS vs CSK IPL 2024 Stat Highlights \"We just need to play good cricket. In terms of the playoff race, in 13 years of playing IPL, I have never seen a team out of the playoffs race or qualified before 13-14 games are done. We are still in the race and as a team, we know when we play high-quality cricket and everyone knows their job well, we know we can beat any team on any ground,\" the right-arm fast bowler said in the post-match press conference. The stand-in skipper Sam Curran also praised the bowling unit after the match and said that it was a tough batting pitch. \"Thought we bowled really well. Rahul Chahar and Harshal were amazing, I was pretty happy at the halfway point but unfortunately, it was not meant to be. The wicket was probably slower than we thought, we expected a little more pace and bounce, it was pretty similar throughout the game,\" Curran said in the post-match presentation ceremony. Punjab lost two early wickets, with the in-form Jonny Bairstow and Rilee Rossouw getting out within the first two overs. But Shashank Singh and Prabhsimran Singh kept their hopes alive with a solid 53-run partnership. \"I think with that opening spell, we were still in the game when Prabhsimran Singh and Shashank Singh were batting. Even though we lost two early wickets, we recovered with Prabhsimran and Shashank in the middle during the powerplay. I think we were quite settled at that point. If we had made better choices on which bowlers to target, we could have a different conclusion to the game,\" the 33-year-old said. Punjab will next take on Royal Challengers Bangalore at the same venue under the lights, and Harshal opened up on the learnings for his side ahead of the crucial next game. \"I think coming into this game, we thought that this would be a high-scoring venue because of the size of the boundary. Usually, this pitch has a lot of pace and bounce. But it was not like that, especially today. The next game we play will be a night game. So, it might be a little different and we might see 30-40 more runs on the surface. The lessons we have learned is that if we bowl hard length, close to the stumps, and keep stumps in play at all times, there is enough reward for bowlers and shot-making is difficult from that length,\" he said. Meanwhile, Rs 40 lakh was raised during the match in Dharamsala on Sunday to support girl child education. The M3M Foundation, in partnership with Shikhar Dhawan Foundation, has committed support to females for vocational education, and Rs 5 Lakh will be donated for every 25 runs scored and 3 wickets taken by Punjab Kings during their home games.

Every team gets a bad day. All we can do is focus on the next game as this one is in the past. We can’t reverse it, however much we think about it. We have to look into the areas we can work and prepare for the next game,” said Naveen at the post-match press conference. LSG bowlers had a day to forget as KKR became the first team to register a 200+ score in an IPL game at the Ekana Stadium. Naveen, who was LSG’s best bowler with figures of 3/49 in four overs, admitted that Sunday’s surface favoured the batters while also conceding that his team’s batting display left a lot to desire. READ | KKR moves top of IPL 2024 points table with thumping win over LSG “In the games we have played here, I think this was the best wicket to bat on. It wasn’t stopping or gripping. They bowled well, and we didn’t. We didn’t quite do the same thing we did in the chases we pulled off,” said the Afghan pacer. KKR’s bowling performance was led by fast bowler Harshit Rana, who marked his comeback from a one-match ban – for a breach of IPL’s code of conduct – with a three-wicket haul. “I feel we read the wicket pretty well. We had a clear idea of what to do on this pitch and what lengths to bowl, and that helped us in our win,” said Harshit after the match. The 22-year-old also emphasised the trust KKR has in his senior colleague Mitchell Starc, who has endured a tough reinitiation to the IPL, going at 11.37 runs per over this season. “There is no doubt over Starc. We have total belief in him, and he did win us the game against Mumbai Indias. The team trusts him to win us more matches. All this talk of lack of wickets and economy rate doesn’t make any difference in our belief in him,” added Harshit.', 'Number of Words': 367}\n",

Canadian Police arrested three Indians on Friday linked to Nijjar’s killing in June last year. Karan Brar, 22, Kamalpreet Singh, 22, and Karanpreet Singh, 28, all Indian nationals residing in Edmonton, were charged with first-degree murder and conspiracy to commit murder. Underlining that the probe into Nijjar’s death is Canada’s internal matter and has nothing to do with India, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar has said New Delhi will wait for information from the Canadian police regarding the arrests. Refuge in Canada The inputs shared by top intelligence sources shed light on the operations of seven “A Category” gangsters from Punjab, who have found refuge in Canada and are said to be involved in a myriad of criminal activities. Even with their notorious criminal history in Punjab, these individuals were granted visas to Canada, where they continued their nefarious activities with impunity. Their criminal endeavours range from extortion and drug trafficking to targeted killings and terrorist activities, with connections to various Khalistan groups.

There's a reason for that\", 'Link': 'https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/transportation/airlines-/-aviation/commercial-jet-maker-airbus-is-staying-humble-even-as-boeing-flounders-theres-a-reason-for-that/articleshow/109871603.cms', 'PubDate': '2024-05-06 09:49:29', 'Body': \" (You can now subscribe to our (You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel In the latest round of their decades-long battle for dominance in commercial aircraft, Europe’s Airbus established a clear sales lead over Boeing even before the American company encountered more fallout from manufacturing problems and ongoing safety concerns.Airbus has outpaced Boeing for five straight years in plane orders and deliveries, and just reported a 28% quarterly increase in net profit. It was already winning market share by beating Boeing to develop a line of fuel-efficient, mid-sized aircraft that are cheaper for airlines to fly.And now Boeing is facing a government-mandated production cap on its best-selling plane.Yet the European company is unlikely to extend its advantage in the Airbus-Boeing duopoly much further despite having customers clamoring for more commercial aircraft, according to aviation analysts. The reason: Airbus already is making planes as fast as it can and has a backlog of more than 8,600 orders to fill.Its ability to leverage Boeing’s troubles therefore is “very limited,” according to Jonathan Berger, managing director at Alton Aviation Consultancy. Between strained supply chains and the long lead times for a hugely complex and highly regulated product, a jetliner ordered from Airbus today may not arrive until the end of the decade.Boeing also has a huge order backlog for more than 5,660 commercial planes. The mismatch between the post-COVID demand for flights and the aircraft supply pipeline is bad news for travelers as well as airlines.“This has been an incredibly strong market recovery, and people need more jets than they’re getting,” said Richard Aboulafia, a managing director at AeroDynamic Advisory. “And until they get those jets, you don’t have enough capacity. Guess what goes up? Ticket prices.”At the beginning of the year, Boeing seemed finally to be recovering from two crashes of Max jets in 2018 and 2019 that killed 346 people in Indonesia and Ethiopia. Then, on Jan. 5, a door plug blew out of an Alaska Airlines 737 Max 9 , and the company has been reeling ever since.Boeing has since slowed manufacturing at the order of the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration. It lost $355 million in the first quarter because of a decline in aircraft deliveries and compensation it paid to airlines for a temporary grounding of Max 9s. The Max was Boeing’s answer to Airbus’ A320 family of planes.Airbus, which is registered in the Netherlands but has its main headquarters in France, is taking a conspicuously cautious and even modest stance toward its recent success and its rival’s woes. CEO Guillaume Faury has said he’s “not happy” about Boeing’s troubles and they’re not good for the industry as a whole.In an April 25 call with journalists, Faury was reserved about how much the company could speed up production, even with 8.7 billion euros in cash on hand. Airbus was managing “a diversity of challenges” in getting the parts it needs, he said, and must “make sure that we ramp up at a pace that is compatible with the weakest suppliers.”Faury stressed that any moves to expand production would be done with an eye to “our core pillars of safety, quality, integrity, compliance and security.”Airbus and Boeing have manufacturing constraints in part because the two companies are not so much aircraft makers as “aircraft assemblers” that rely on thousands of parts made by other companies, from the fuselage and engines to electronics and interiors, Alton Aviation's Berger noted. Since “the supply chains are going as fast as they can,” Airbus is not in a position to swoop in and take Boeing's customers.The European company scored a symbolic win, however, when United Airlines lined up leases for 35 Airbus jets because of delays that Boeing faces in getting its new, larger Max 10 approved by U.S. regulators.Given that, “Airbus is playing it well. They’re being very, very humble. It’s smart because they can’t exploit it,” Berger said.Airbus last year topped Boeing for the fifth straight year in the orders race, with 2,094 net orders and 735 delivered planes. Boeing had 1,314 net orders and delivered 528 aircraft.Airbus currently leads Boeing in sales of large single-aisle planes 80%-20%, according to figures from Alton Aviation Consultancy. The matchup between the smaller Airbus A320 and Boeing’s 737 Max 7 and Max 8 is more even; Airbus is ahead on delivered planes but Boeing is ahead 54%-46% when the European company's order backlog is counted.Airbus' success is not just due to Boeing's missteps. The company is benefiting from its decision to launch the A321neo, a single-aisle aircraft with 180 to 230 seats. “Neo” stands for new engine option, meaning highly fuel efficient engines that save airlines money on one of their biggest costs. Boeing rushed to match with the Max, a 737 equipped with new, more efficient engines, only to run into trouble with the crashes and door plug.Airbus also benefited from a deal to take over the smaller A220 developed by Canada’s Bombardier. Boeing is without a competing product in that niche. Analysts say Airbus has a further edge with the forthcoming A321XLR, a model that will allow airlines to use cheaper narrow-body jets on long-haul flights.Yet the company already has pushed its deadline to produce 75 A320 and A321 jets per month from 2025 to 2026, and it moved the promised delivery date for the A321XLR from the second quarter of 2024 to the third.“Boeing is winning some orders because Airbus can’t supply the airplanes,” Scott Hamilton, managing director of the Leeham Company consultancy, said. “So Airbus really can’t gain much more in the way of market share because they are sold out.”The current pace of production at the two companies means older, less fuel-efficient planes are going to have to fly longer before being retired so airlines won't be able to reduce fuel costs. And older planes require more maintenance to keep flying, which costs money but doesn’t affect safety if the maintenance is done right. For travelers, it means discounted tickets will be harder to come by.Could another entrant shake up the duopoly, as Tesla did for autos? Not for years to come, analysts said.Brazil's Embraer makes smaller regional jets, and so far has not moved to compete with Boeing and Airbus. China’s COMAC has taken more than 1,000 orders for its narrow-body C919 plane but is “at least a decade or two” away from presenting a strong competitor, according to Berger.That means a two-company race remains the game for now - even if one of them is under-performing.“The airlines need at least two,” Berger said. “They don’t want to put themselves in a monopolistic situation.

VK Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist, Geojit Financial Services, said, “The cut of 172 points on the Nifty last Friday is rumoured to be triggered by fears of changes in the long-term capital gains tax in the Budget after elections. The finance minister quickly clarified that these are speculative. This clarification and positive global cues are likely to support the market in the near-term.” The US jobs data for April has come lower-than-expected, indicating weakening labour market and slowing economy. The US unemployment rose to 3.9 per cent in April. So the possibility of a rate cut by the Fed has again brightened. The decline in the dollar index to 105.8 and the cut in the 10-year US bond yield to 4.49 per cent augur well for the market. Positive comment by Warren Buffett that India is an untapped market with great potential is hugely important. FIIs can take a cue from that rather than react every time to changes in US bond yields, per analysts. Kotak Mahindra Bank is likely to respond positively to its impressive Q4 results.

As the US pauses at the same crossroads, it needs to consider whether free trade or protectionism promises the more prosperous route.The UK’s marriage of manufacturing prowess and open commerce made it the pre-eminent power of the 19th century. By the closing decades of the century, it accounted for about a quarter of the world’s industrial output. Beneath the veneer of imperial confidence lay deep anxieties, however, thanks to the rise of new powers.In Chicago, the Union Stock Yards sprawled over an area half the size of the old City of London, employed tens of thousands, and processed enough meat to feed 80% of America’s population. Henry Ford copied the Yards’ production-line innovations in Detroit to build car factories on a scale the world had never seen. In Ludwigshafen south of Stuttgart, Britain lost its early lead in chemicals to BASF SE, whose vast integrated plants gave Germany a near-monopoly by 1900.Joseph Chamberlain, who’d quit the world’s biggest screw-making business before it lost ground to US and German competitors and had since become one of Britain’s most influential politicians, saw the answer in a retreat from the Empire’s free-trade traditions. “Tariffs! They are the politics of the future, and of the near future,” he told a dinner of parliamentary colleagues in 1902.The resulting policy was Imperial Preference, which promised to impose steep levies on imports from outside the Empire. It was a dominant political tendency until the Second World War shattered Britain’s pretensions to global hegemony. Its shadow has fallen across the UK’s anguished relationship with the European Union’s trading bloc ever since.The parallels with present day America as it confronts China’s manufacturing prowess are striking. As in late Victorian Britain, a dominant power is being confronted with a rival that’s better endowed with land and labor, and fast catching up in terms of capital. Furthermore, China is prepared to invest and build on a scale that overwhelms the competition. Like Henry Ford — who consolidated every process in his vast River Rouge complex, and even sought to own coal mines, iron ore pits and rubber plantations to supply raw materials — China’s dominance of the clean technology supply chain looks close to absolute.It produces 84% of the world’s solar modules and 86% of its lithium-ion batteries, as well as 67% of the nacelles that join wind turbines' blades to their towers, and 70% of electrolyzers for manufacturing green hydrogen, according to BloombergNEF. About 60% of the world’s electric vehicles were sold in China last year, according to the International Energy Agency.Exports of its cheap, high-quality autos are already roiling the global car industry, causing increasing fears in Washington that they’ll wind up outcompeting homegrown players.“We’re standing up against the Chinese government’s unfair economic practice and industrial over-capacity,” President Joe Biden told an audience of steelworkers in Pittsburgh April 17, promising higher tariffs on Chinese metals and shipbuilding. “We’re in a stronger position to win the economic competition of the 21st century against China.”That remains to be seen.Britain’s attempt to use trade to win a previous century’s economic race was brief. Imperial Preference was only policy from 1932 (when the country introduced a 10% across-the-board tariff oddly similar to the rate now being floated by Donald Trump) until the era of liberalization that followed World War II. For all the angst of the early 20th century, the UK remained a top-five manufacturing power alongside France and behind the US, Japan and Germany until the 2000s, when first China and Italy, and then South Korea, India, Mexico and Russia overtook.The fate of the nations that committed more firmly to protectionism was less forgiving. Latin American countries started the postwar era richer than most of their Asian counterparts, and introduced high tariffs as a way to build up local industries in contrast to the free-trading approach of Singapore, Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea. The outcome was sclerotic manufacturing sectors, growth that sputtered after an initial burst of enthusiasm, and a debt burden that lingered for decades.The US won’t head down a path as grim as that. Its population, abundance of resources, capital and technological expertise will make it a top-three power for as long as any plausible projections extend. But the situation at the dawn of the colonial era in 1750, when Mughal India and Qing China each accounted for more than a quarter of the world’s industrial production, seems a much more plausible outcome for the 21st century than one where protectionism in one great power cuts another one off from the rest of the world.Washington’s accustomed hegemony may be harder to maintain in a future where multiple continent-sized industrial economies are jostling for primacy. Still, it will be all but impossible if America retreats into an isolationist shell.\", 'Number of Words': 830}\n",

Here are the dates when banks will be closed and in which regions this week: May 7: RBI has declared key phases of the Lok Sabha election 2024 to be a bank holiday already. Hence, on May 7th, a total of 94 Lok Sabha constituencies will be going to the polls as part of the third phase of the Election. That is why, banks will be closed on May 7th.

The militaries of India and China have been locked in a standoff since May 2020 and a full resolution of the border row has not yet been achieved though the two sides have had several rounds of talks at the diplomatic and military levels. What we are witnessing today is for the first time in a human race, a democratic nation of 1.4 billion people has shown exponential growth in the economic arena,\" Aghi, the president of the US-India Strategic and Partnership Forum (USISPF), said. Growing at seven-eight per cent, India\\'s economy is now touching USD 4 trillion. \"It is still very small when you compare it to the global GDP, which is around USD 105 trillion. We are still around 3 to 3.5 per cent of the global GDP, he told Indian-American entrepreneurs. His remarks came as he participated in a panel discussion New Global India at the TiECon, the largest gathering of entrepreneurs and tech professionals organised by TiE Silicon Valley from May 1 to 3. More important is what we are seeing is the challenges India faces as it tries to grow its economy. One of the biggest challenges it faces is China. China in every aspect will never treat India as an equal partner, he said. China is a military power, an economic and a technology power. Basically, its objective is to dominate starting with the Asian Pacific. It sees India as a challenge,\" Aghi said. That\\'s where India has to find a balance to continue its economic trajectory for the next 20-plus years without having a war with this neighbour with which it shares a border of 3,000 kilometres, he said. \"Chinese do realise that. So, what they\\'re doing is a thousand-cut strategy. They moved a hundred thousand troops on the border. India has to move another 100,000 thousand troops. So, it\\'s eating into the capital defence budget, spending less on capital investment, and more on operation. That\\'s the Chinese strategy,\" he said. At the same time, Aghi said, the US sees India as a pivotal partner. He said the US has more joint exercises with India than any other country in the world. China also poses the greatest threat to the United States, he said. The US for the first time after the Second World War is facing an adversary of this magnitude, which unlike its previous adversaries like Russia is both a military and economic power, Aghi said. Participating in the panel discussion, Satyan Gajwani, Times Internet vice chairman, said that in the last five years, India has seen a political machinery that is responsive and proactive. The amount of policy evolution that\\'s happening around financial services in India is breathtaking to the point where you feel like the regulator is as current as the latest startup. Whereas here you watch Congressional hearings, and you see Congressmen asking CEOs how to fix their wifi, he said. India is now sort of an idea which is fairly global in its reach rather than sort of a nation-state which is defined within the geographical boundaries of India, Motwani said. J Sai Deepak, Supreme Court advocate, told the audience that Bharat cannot hope to forge its path ahead purely on economic lines without addressing certain civilisation issues. That I think is what will ultimately give it the currency to sit on the high table of big powers. Because if you\\'re internally weak, no matter how much you project strength outside, there is a fundamental hollowness to your strength or to your being, which will continue to plague you. It could also hand leverage to people who are interested in seeing India crush, Sai Deepak said.', 'Number of Words': 654}\n",

Padma Rao Goud is confident of winning the Lok Sabha election from Secunderabad constituency based on the development work, which was undertaken during the BRS rule. He also believes that his personal connection in the constituency, where he was born, brought up and prospered, will give him a lead over his rival candidates.Excerpts:Q How is your election campaign going on? What are the major requests coming from the public?People are giving a positive response to our campaigns. In the past 10 years, they have seen the development BRS did in the city, and the result of that is evident with the state elections. The public is strongly supporting me and the BRS, and they want me to continue developing Secunderabad.Q. Initially, you had a hesitation towards contesting in the Lok Sabha elections, but rumours suggested that BRS supremo K. Chandrashekhar Rao convinced you otherwise. Why were you sceptical about the Lok Sabha?I was not averse to the Lok Sabha elections. After winning the assembly elections, we haven’t yet settled in. And contesting in a parliamentary election is a big task as we have to cover seven Assembly constituencies, conduct meetings, organise programmes and conduct door-to-door campaigns. That was why I was hesitant, not because I am ill-disposed to the candidacy.Q Who is your major opposition in this election?The contest in this election lies between BRS and BJP candidates. Kishan Reddy asks votes in the name of Ram Mandir, or Narendra Modi. We are asking for votes only on the basis of development in Hyderabad. We have built a monumental temple in Yadagirigutta too, but we don’t have to ask for votes in the name of temples. Our work speaks for itself.Q How is the support coming from minorities in Secunderabad constituency?We have immense support from the minorities. There was some apprehension over vote splitting by Congress candidates, but the Congress candidate is in third place in the election and as far as my knowledge goes, even AIMIM is not supporting them. We are getting a wave of positive feedback from the Marwari, Sikhs and Gujarati communities.Q If you win in the Lok Sabha election, will you bring someone from your family to contest as an MLA in your seat?There is nothing like that. We will act only upon the instructions of our leader Chandrashekhar Rao. It is natural for a politician’s son expecting to become a politician, just like a businessman’s son wanting to join his business. But ultimately, the decision lies in the hands of our leader.Q The BRS has received a lot of negativity, be it Kaleshwaram Project’s issues, or general adversity towards the BRS. Do you think that will affect you in this election?I have been in the public for more than 40 years now, and have been an MLA in 2004, 2014, 2018 and in 2023. In all this time, the majority of the votes I received are because of who I am. Everybody knows who I am in Secunderabad.

Airbus has outpaced Boeing for five straight several years in aircraft orders and deliveries, and just noted a 28% quarterly raise in internet revenue. It was previously successful market share by beating Boeing to develop a line of gasoline-economical, mid-sized plane that are much less expensive for airways to fly. And now Boeing is dealing with a govt-mandated production cap on its very best-promoting plane. However the European corporation is not likely to prolong its edge in the Airbus-Boeing duopoly much more irrespective of having consumers clamoring for additional commercial plane, in accordance to aviation analysts. The motive: Airbus previously is earning planes as quick as it can and has a backlog of much more than 8,600 orders to fill. Its skill to leverage Boeing’s difficulties as a result is “very limited,” in accordance to Jonathan Berger, handling director at Alton Aviation Consultancy. Involving strained supply chains and the very long guide instances for a massively advanced and hugely regulated merchandise, a jetliner ordered from Airbus nowadays might not arrive until finally the conclude of the 10 years. Boeing also has a substantial buy backlog for a lot more than 5,660 business planes. The mismatch in between the write-up-COVID desire for flights and the aircraft source pipeline is lousy news for vacationers as effectively as airlines. “This has been an exceptionally solid market restoration, and people today want more jets than they’re getting,” stated Richard Aboulafia, a running director at AeroDynamic Advisory. “And until they get people jets, you never have sufficient capacity. Guess what goes up? Ticket price ranges.” At the starting of the calendar year, Boeing seemed last but not least to be recovering from two crashes of Max jets in 2018 and 2019 that killed 346 individuals in Indonesia and Ethiopia. Then, on Jan. 5, a doorway plug blew out of an Alaska Airways 737 Max 9, and the firm has been reeling at any time due to the fact. Boeing has due to the fact slowed producing at the purchase of the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration. It misplaced $355 million in the to start with quarter since of a decrease in plane deliveries and compensation it paid out to airways for a short-term grounding of Max 9s. The Max was Boeing’s answer to Airbus’ A320 relatives of planes. Airbus, which is registered in the Netherlands but has its most important headquarters in France, is getting a conspicuously careful and even modest stance toward its modern results and its rival’s woes. CEO Guillaume Faury has explained he’s “not happy” about Boeing’s troubles and they’re not great for the market as a full. In an April 25 get in touch with with journalists, Faury was reserved about how significantly the company could velocity up creation, even with 8.7 billion euros in hard cash on hand. Airbus was taking care of “a variety of challenges” in finding the elements it desires, he said, and must “make guaranteed that we ramp up at a tempo that is appropriate with the weakest suppliers.” Faury pressured that any moves to increase production would be completed with an eye to “our core pillars of protection, top quality, integrity, compliance and stability.” Airbus and Boeing have production constraints in portion due to the fact the two companies are not so substantially plane makers as “aircraft assemblers” that rely on hundreds of areas manufactured by other businesses, from the fuselage and engines to electronics and interiors, Alton Aviation’s Berger pointed out. Since “the provide chains are heading as quickly as they can,” Airbus is not in a position to swoop in and acquire Boeing’s buyers. The European business scored a symbolic gain, nevertheless, when United Airways lined up leases for 35 Airbus jets because of delays that Boeing faces in finding its new, larger Max 10 permitted by U.S. regulators. Provided that, “Airbus is playing it properly. They are staying quite, extremely humble. It’s intelligent since they just cannot exploit it,” Berger stated. Airbus previous 12 months topped Boeing for the fifth straight 12 months in the orders race, with 2,094 web orders and 735 shipped planes. Boeing experienced 1,314 net orders and sent 528 aircraft. Airbus now leads Boeing in product sales of substantial solitary-aisle planes 80%-20%, according to figures from Alton Aviation Consultancy. The matchup among the smaller sized Airbus A320 and Boeing’s 737 Max 7 and Max 8 is far more even Airbus is forward on shipped planes but Boeing is forward 54%-46% when the European company’s get backlog is counted. Airbus’ results is not just owing to Boeing’s missteps. The company is benefiting from its selection to start the A321neo, a solitary-aisle plane with 180 to 230 seats. “Neo” stands for new motor alternative, indicating very gas economical engines that help save airways dollars on a person of their biggest costs. Boeing rushed to match with the Max, a 737 equipped with new, additional effective engines, only to operate into hassle with the crashes and doorway plug. Airbus also benefited from a deal to acquire over the more compact A220 made by Canada’s Bombardier. Boeing is with out a competing merchandise in that specialized niche. Analysts say Airbus has a even further edge with the forthcoming A321XLR, a design that will enable airlines to use less costly slim-system jets on very long-haul flights. However the organization now has pushed its deadline to develop 75 A320 and A321 jets per thirty day period from 2025 to 2026, and it moved the promised shipping and delivery day for the A321XLR from the 2nd quarter of 2024 to the 3rd. “Boeing is winning some orders mainly because Airbus can’t provide the airplanes,” Scott Hamilton, taking care of director of the Leeham Company consultancy, mentioned. “So Airbus truly simply cannot get much more in the way of industry share mainly because they are bought out.” The latest tempo of creation at the two businesses means older, fewer fuel-productive planes are likely to have to fly for a longer period prior to remaining retired so airlines would not be able to lower gas charges. And older planes require a lot more maintenance to retain traveling, which expenditures dollars but doesn’t impact security if the routine maintenance is accomplished proper. For tourists, it means discounted tickets will be more durable to occur by. Could a different entrant shake up the duopoly, as Tesla did for autos? Not for several years to appear, analysts explained. Brazil’s Embraer makes smaller regional jets, and so considerably has not moved to contend with Boeing and Airbus. China’s COMAC has taken additional than 1,000 orders for its narrow-entire body C919 plane but is “at least a 10 years or two” absent from presenting a solid competitor, according to Berger. That signifies a two-corporation race continues to be the match for now – even if one of them is under-carrying out. “The airways need at least two,” Berger said. “They really don’t want to set by themselves in a monopolistic predicament. So everybody’s cheering for Boeing to get their act alongside one another.” ___ AP Airways Writer David Koenig in Dallas contributed to this story.', 'Number of Words': 1228}\n",

Trump, whose own rhetoric has drawn accusations of fascist tendencies from civil rights groups and other critics, made the comparison with the Nazi police in Germany\\'s World War Two regime at a donor retreat Saturday night at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach, Florida. The comments came after Trump reprised his complaint that the multiple indictments against him were politically motivated. He had just concluded 11 days of a New York hush money trial in which he is charged with falsifying business records to cover up a $130,000 payment made to a porn star. \"These people are running a Gestapo administration,\" Trump said, according to an audio recording heard by the New York Times and the Washington Post. \"And it\\'s the only thing they have. And it\\'s the only way they\\'re going to win, in their opinion, and it\\'s actually killing them. But it doesn\\'t bother me.\" The Trump campaign did not respond to a request for comment on the reported remarks. In a statement, White House spokesman Andrew Bates sought to contrast Biden\\'s conduct in office with Trump\\'s latest remark, accusing the former president of echoing fascist rhetoric, \"lunching with neo-Nazis and fanning debunked conspiracy theories that have cost brave police officers their lives.\" \"President Biden is bringing the American people together around our shared democratic values and the rule of law - an approach that has delivered the biggest violent crime reduction in 50 years,\" said Bates. Trump, who held office from 2017 to 2021, faces an array of legal troubles in criminal and civil cases while he seeks to regain the presidency in the Nov. 5 election. He denies wrongdoing in all the cases. Trump has made a series of inflammatory and racist statements on the campaign trail, using violent imagery to lambaste immigrants and opponents. He has warned of possible violence if he doesn\\'t win the 2024 election and has compared immigrants to animals. In November, Biden attacked Trump for using the word \"vermin\" to refer to his political enemies, saying it echoed the language of Nazi Germany. Also last year, Trump said immigrants who entered the country illegally were \"poisoning the blood of our country.\" Some historians say such comments mirror that of autocrats who have sought to dehumanize their foes. The Trump campaign has previously rejected comparisons to Nazis, Adolf Hitler and Italy\\'s Benito Mussolini. The Jewish Council for Public Affairs denounced the Nazi comparison on Sunday. \"It\\'s always wrong, offensive, and despicable to make comparisons like this — even more so when taken alongside the former president\\'s long history of normalizing antisemitism,\" said Amy Spitalnick, chief executive of the public policy group. It was \"especially heinous to use Nazi comparisons in the service of a bigoted, authoritarian agenda,\" she said. On Saturday night, Trump again took swipes at the federal and Georgia prosecutors working on cases against him, according to the media reports. Trump, a former New York businessman and reality television host, described Mexican immigrants as rapists and drug smugglers as he declared his candidacy for the Republican nomination in the 2016 election. He drew widespread criticism after a violent 2017 rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, for equating white supremacists with counter-protesters and saying \"both sides\" were to blame. Biden has said the events in Charlottesville, where one woman was killed, motivated him to run for president against Trump in 2020.', 'Number of Words': 600}\n",

I’ve always wanted to chronicle the history of my maternal family. Yet, it was the shocking and brutal murder of Australian missionary Graham Staines and his young sons in Orissa in 1999 that affected me deeply. The attacks on Christian missionaries and converts have continued and with each new event, I wanted to understand why conversion is such a layered word in our modern society. Knowing that my maternal great grandparents, who were part of the Bhantu tribe, had converted to Christianity, I yearned for deeper insights into this aspect of my lineage. The book opens with a family tree. Tell us about the roots, trunk, and branches of marriages and relationships in your family. Scholars widely acknowledge the Bhantus as one of the original inhabitants of this land. As the narrative unfolds, it becomes evident that our roots run deep, with marriages and natural expansion extending our trunk and branches far and wide. There has been religious conversion to Methodism, Catholicism, Shiism along the way and this expansion not only holds true for our family but has also contributed to the diversity of our nation. How has your own understanding of and connection to the past developed/enriched during the research process? During an interview for the book, I had the privilege of speaking with noted Bhantu activist and documentary filmmaker Dakxin Chhara. It was then that I uncovered a Bhantu identity previously unknown to me. The realisation that Bhantus continue to be viewed with suspicion and that development has largely eluded their society fills me withastonishment and a deep sense of humility regarding my own privilege. What is the nexus between colonialism and caste? The implementation of the Criminal Tribes Acts from the 1870s not only reinforced existing caste hierarchies but also perpetuated Orientalist stereotypes, such as the concept of hereditary crime. Not all Bhantus engaged in criminal activities, nor did all Nat tribes perform circus-like feats or tricks. These were harmful generalisations. For example, my own great-grandfather, Hardayal Singh, and his family were nomadic herders and hunter-gatherers. They preserved stories of Bhantu bravery. Nomadic tribes played significant roles in India’s independence movement. They sang dissenting songs and served as vital messengers between revolutionaries. With the imposition of CTA, my ancestors were relegated to camp only on the outskirts of villages and had to report their intentions to local police stations well in advance. You describe caste as a phoenix in the book. For converted Christians and converted Muslims, the spectre of caste lingers regardless of how far they believe they have progressed. Even with socio-economic advancement, the stigma and discrimination associated with caste can persist affecting various social interactions, marriage prospects, and access to opportunities. The book talks at length about Hardayal’s daughters. How have they inspired you? Hardayal and Kalyani were the pioneering feminists of our family. I attribute my education to their vision of nurturing economically independent daughters, despite the challenges they faced along the way. The lives of Hardayal’s daughters inspired me greatly. In particular, my great aunt Dorothy. She defied societal expectations and emerged as a fiercely independent woman. She was a nurse in Iraq during the tumultuous period of the Second World War. However, it was my grandmother and Hardayal’s youngest daughter, Prudence, who truly captured my admiration. Despite being a working woman and a homemaker, she dedicated herself to creating a nurturing home environment and ensuring the success of her children. Your latest short film Pilibhit won the IPTDA Award for the Best Cinematographer 2022 and you were also the DoP for Zakir Khan’s Chacha Vidhayak Hain Humare. How did your training as a cinematographer help you with the writing of the book? As a cinematographer, years of reading scripts has trained my mind to visualise words as vivid images. The sensory experiences of smell, colour, and other non-tactile emotions all contributed to this creative process. Utilising a narrative voice in the book allowed my cinematographer’s brain to effortlessly imagine childhood scenes.

Vaswani emphasised that the RBI’s financial impact on the private lender’s business is ‘minimal,’ noting that only the onboarding of new customers has been barred while existing customers can still access loans or make new deposits. “We remain fully focused on mitigating the current challenges imposed on Kotak Mahindra Bank’s digital lending business. Our focus for this fiscal year will be to deepen existing customer relations through cross-selling instead of new acquisitions,” he said. Last month, RBI barred Kotak Mahindra Bank from onboarding new customers through its online and mobile banking channels. “The Reserve Bank of India has today, in exercise of its powers under Section 35A of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949, directed Kotak Mahindra Bank Limited to cease and desist, with immediate effect, from (i) onboarding of new customers through its online and mobile banking channels and (ii) issuing fresh credit cards.,” the central bank said in a statement. The RBI said that the bank will continue to provide services to its existing customers, including its credit card customers. The central bank stated that it implemented these measures in response to concerns arising from its IT examination of the bank and its persistent failure to comprehensively and promptly address these concerns. Vashwani noted that the financial repercussions are projected to be minimal. This estimation arises from the fact that the cost of acquisition outweighs the revenue generated in the initial year of onboarding new customers. “For Kotak 811 and new credit card issuances, the acquisition cost is usually higher than revenue in the first year of customer onboarding. The amount of technology spent involved here is also higher, so we need to re-prioritise that,” he said. This is not the first instance of the central bank taking such action. In 2020, the RBI imposed similar restrictions on HDFC Bank, preventing the bank from initiating new digital business activities and acquiring new credit card customers. These restrictions on HDFC Bank were lifted nearly two years later, in 2022. In recent years, the RBI has taken several measures to enhance regulation within the rapidly expanding digital banking and lending sector. These actions encompassed the issuance of digital lending guidelines and the establishment of a framework for payment aggregators. Earlier this year, the RBI also imposed curbs on Paytm Payments Bank’s multiple business activities. However, this action against the payments bank stemmed from persistent non-compliances and continued material supervisory concerns.\", 'Number of Words': 507}\n",

For all the noise made by activists, journalists, politicians and even celebrities about the clothing industry destroying the planet, shoppers aren\\'t listening.The information is out there if they want it. Google can produce more than 88 million search results on why fashion is bad for the environment, but the world remains in a state of cognitive dissonance, fueled by its voracious appetite for disposable trends. Global apparel consumption, currently at 62 million tons per year, is by some estimates projected to reach 102 million tons annually by 2030.One problem, say many industry observers, is that much of the messaging about fashion and sustainability can be too boring, too preachy and too easy to ignore. So is it possible to change the way we talk about it?This week, the outdoor apparel brand Patagonia released a quirky new film that reflects the company\\'s efforts to reset the conversation. \"The Shitthropocene,\" a 45-minute documentary directed by David Garrett Byars , is a trippy mock anthropological view of humanity\\'s consumption habits from our cave-dwelling ancestors through the trendsetting aristocratic court of Louis XIV, creepy fairgrounds, fishing waders with leaky crotches, mindless digital advertising and pretty much everything in between. It will be shown in Patagonia stores across the United States in coming months.The cheeky romp toggles between a marketing yarn for Patagonia and the way they make their products, information about the climate crisis, consumer psychology and relentless attempts at humor that range from outlandish satire to the knowingly juvenile. The title is a scatological wink at the word anthropocene, a term used to describe the time during which humans have had a substantial impact on our planet, a fitting clue to viewers of what lies in store.\"Many scientists and historians think we\\'re entering into a new epoch -- one where things are simply well, crappier,\" declares the opening voice-over in a thick northern English accent (regularly used in Britain to indicate no-nonsense, tongue-in-cheek pragmatism). YouTube commenters on the trailer point to similarities -- perhaps intentional, perhaps unintentional -- to the fictional British television correspondent Philomena Cunk as she attempts to cover all of human history with sardonic humor and deadpan naivete.Vanilla corporate lingo this is not, though it\\'s on brand for Patagonia. After all, the company was behind the audacious \"Don\\'t Buy This Jacket\" advertising campaign released on Black Friday in 2011, encouraging people to purchase only what they need and reconsider their effect on the environment. In 2022, its billionaire founder, Yvon Chouinard, placed the company finances into a special trust that ensured its profits would be used to combat climate change.Patagonia Films has previously produced straight-talking films targeting the salmon fishing industry and rising oceans, hydropower dams and America\\'s public lands. Other labels, including Puma and Diesel, have invested in documentaries about their supply chains that are generally intended to be promoted on social media platforms. But Patagonia likes to define itself by doing things differently.Is it a gamble that pays off?Not really. The sheer scope of information covered in 45 minutes is vast and ambitious, with a good array of talking heads eloquently dissecting why fashion keeps us hungry for more even when we know its damaging effect on the world around us. Byars is also rightly aware of the complications of having a brand that sells products sponsoring his movie. It is referred to frequently by the narrator, including in a sendup of corporate greenwashing in a fake ad praising Patagonia for \"making fleeces from upcycled Subarus and, contrary to laws of physics, creating more water for planet.\"But the movie jumps around at a breakneck pace from one eye-popping scene and concept to the next.

Despite standing at just 6ft 5″, the Alabama-born thrived against adversities time and again to reach the MVP and All-Star caliber. However, his short stature prevented him from actively engaging in one key facet of the game: trash-talking. Advertisement During his latest appearance on Club Shay Shay, Barkley shed light on his competitive mindset from his playing days. Chuck highlighted how facing taller players throughout his career developed his strategic thinking. Consequently, while competing in the NBA, he was more bothered about how to mitigate the opposition’s on-court abilities than what to say to them to assert dominance. On top of this, the 58-year-old showcased his humility, admitting his inability to display authority with his relatively shorter size for his position. As a result, the 1993 MVP had to formulate innovative methods to stand a chance against his contemporaries. Outlining the limitations to his skillset, Barkley mentioned the following: “If you’re Michael [Jordan], LeBron [James], Kobe [Bryant], Shaq [Shaquille O’Neal], you can outtalent 99% of the guys in the world. But when you’re a 6ft 5″ power forward, you can’t outtalent people…You can’t out-talent people at my size, you have to use your brain”. These words highlighted Chuck’s understanding and knowledge of his craft. The 11x All-Star never shied away from acknowledging his uncontrollable disadvantages. Rather, he rarely let them get the best of him. After all, his focus solely remained on perfecting the controllable aspects of his gameplay, as he continually aspired to become the best version of himself. Charles Barkley might not have revealed the entire truth Amidst the recent declaration, certain comments from his contemporaries point towards a different past. Kevin Garnett revealed one such lesser-known aspect of his display during a 2021 episode of All The Smoke. Reminiscing about his time playing against Chuck, KG revealed the following: “Charles Barkley was another level trash talker because he would end up fighting you or try to fight you. But he instilled fear in everybody on the court“. Undoubtedly, Barkley intentionally refused to touch on this during his latest interview. However, it might well have been a part of his strategizing against his opponent. Nevertheless, his antics bore fruit on the court, aiding in solidifying his legacy as an all-time great.', 'Number of Words': 388}\n",

The birds are also known as ‘Panichiri’ in local parlance. Thirty five of the eggs have hatched and Forest Department officials are making every effort to keep the newborn birds safe. The Indian skimmer is a rare species. According to a bird census conducted worldwide, there are only 4,000 such birds left. The decreasing population of the bird has prompted the International Union of Conservation of Nature (IUCN) to classify skimmers as ‘endangered’. According to a rough estimate, there are approximately 2,900 adult skimmers left on the face of the earth. In this situation, the Indian skimmers have turned up to lay eggs for the first time on the Mahanadi riverbed. Forest department officials said Sunday at a press conference that approximately 165 birds have arrived. The Indian skimmer plays an important role in protecting the environment. It sucks out oily material floating on water bodies. Hence the preservation of the birds is very important, officials said. Khuntuni forest ranger Nilamadhab Sahu informed that in the days to come, many more baby skimmers are expected as the birds have laid 85 eggs. Ornithologists and bird watchers are happy with the development. They said that if the Forest department starts working in a proper manner, the Khuntuni range can turn into a hub of Indian skimmers. “We will try our level best to protect the species,” Sahu stated. Forest department personnel have been deployed at the site to keep watch round the clock to prevent dogs, jackals or wild animals from eating the eggs. The department is also involving local villagers and fishermen for the protection of the eggs and the birds. Awareness programmes are also being conducted regarding the importance of the birds. The birds also have breeding colonies on the bed of the Chambal river which flows through both Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh.

Himself in fray from Ludhiana Lok Sabha seat, he speaks to Vinod Kumar about his party’s prospects and challenges. Excerpts: After taking over as Punjab Pradesh Congress Committee (PPCC) president, the Lok Sabha elections Why will Punjab vote for Congress and not for BJP, SAD or AAP? Indiscipline has been the Achilles' heel of Congress for long and even cost the party 2022 assembly polls. Party leaders continue to indulge in indiscipline. What do you have to say? How will BJP, SAD, and AAP perform in these elections? There is discontentment among some Congress leaders over denial of tickets. How will you placate them? In the run-up to elections, many leaders have left Congress, criticising the party and its leadership. How do you see it? Will it impact the party’s prospects in the Lok Sabha elections? You are contesting against Ravneet Singh Bittu, whom you consider your friend. What made you fight him? If you manage to win this contest, how will it help your career? Former PPCC president Navjot Singh Sidhu , once a star campaigner, is missing from action. Why isn’t he involved at least in campaigning? Congress and AAP are contesting elections together in many states, but are fighting separately in Punjab. How do you see this contradiction? Delhi Congress president Arvinder Singh Lovely resigned in protest over the alliance with AAP. Do you think Punjab unit was right in convincing the high command against the tie-up? What is the party’s plan for grooming women leaders as 33% reservation for women will come into force in 2029? What changes have been made in the party at the grassroots? Where is Congress in comparison to BJP and SAD, whose strength lies in organisational setup? will be your first big test.How do you see this?While I refrain from making tall claims like chief minister Bhagwant Mann, I am confident that the Congress will secure the majority of the 13 Lok Sabha seats in Punjab. We are working hard as a unit and confident of achieving the goal.The Congress party distinguishes itself through its history of delivering on its commitments, particularly inrelation to major initiatives such as loan waivers for farmers and the implementation of minimum support price (MSP). Congress is the only party that has waived farmers’ loans.Under the leadership of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, the govt waived agricultural loans amounting to Rs 72,000 crore. Similarly, the previous Congress govt in Punjab provided loan waivers to farmers totalling Rs 4,500 crore. The party’s dedication to fulfilling its promises and implementing policies that support the well-being of citizens, especially farmers, has been a hallmark of its governance.While we have implemented strict measures, differences of opinion are natural and are typically resolved through dialogue. Congress is a democratic party, and everyone has the right to voice their views while remaining within party line.The BJP is grappling with extensive protests from farmers due to their oppressive actions. The Akali Dal’s presence in the Vidhan Sabha has been reduced to a mere three seats, and their chances in the Lok Sabha elections appear bleak, as they have lost their integrity and the trust of the people of Punjab. The AAP has betrayed the trust of the Punjabis, who had given them a resounding mandate.The Punjab govt, led by CM Bhagwant Mann, has been unable to deliver on the promises made during their election campaign before the assembly polls. The l ack of substantial progress under the AAP government has only exacerbated the difficulties faced by Punjab and its people across various sectors. The people of Punjab have acknowledged the negative impact of the AAP govt, with the promised ‘badlaav’ only resulting in a detrimental effect. The last two years have been characterised by a series of unfulfilled promises.The number of tickets is limited. While everyone has the right to apply, personal aspirations must sometimes yield to the party’s greater good. When I was the president of the Youth Congress, I also faced this dilemma, but I supported the party. We must have faith in the high command of the party and wait for the right time.Such defections betray voters’ trust and will likely become evident in the upcoming elections. However, I remain confident in the unwavering support of the people of Punjab. They will vote for the ideology of the Congress. The traitors, who once enjoyed the trust and patronage of the Congress and were elected for our cause, betrayed the people. This election will show that such treachery won’t be tolerated, and they will not find any place in the hearts of the electorate.Despite my respect for him, I prioritise Punjab’s well-being over personal relationships, especially given our ideological differences. My love for Punjab motivates me to fight against the anti-Punjab forces. There is a major ideological difference between us. He abandoned our party’s secular ideology in favour of the RSS ideology for personal gain. We will never let the divisive politics of the BJP harm the Punjabis.I remain committed to my ongoing efforts towards the well-being of the people. By the grace of God and with the support of the Ludhiana residents, upon winning the election, I pledge to serve the citizens of Punjab with utmost dedication. My goal is to breathe new life into Ludhiana's industrial sector, often referred to as the ‘Manchester of Punjab,’ while simultaneously working for the betterment ofthe labour community.Navjot Singh Sidhu is a senior member of the party, and I am confident that he will actively campaign for the party in due time.The decision regarding alliance or non-alliance with AAP was strategic and made by both the central and regional leadership. Our focus is solely on Punjab, and we have denied any alliance with AAP in Punjab due to their massive failures.Like the leaders of the Punjab unit, I believe Lovely should have expressed his dissent while the discussions were being held before forming an alliance. Had he done that, I am confident th at the party high command would have taken note of that.Congress is the only party that has championed women’s representation in the country's politics. The Women’s Reservation Bill was the brainchild of Sonia Gandhi, which gave 50% reservation to women in local bodies. We also increased reservation for women from 33% to 50% in Panchayati Raj institutions. The only woman CM of Punjab, Rajinder Kaur Bhattal, was from Congress.Under Capt Amarinder Singh and Sunil Jakhar, PPCC saw a decline in grassroots engagement over two decades. However, I am delighted to share we have successfully revitalised our grassroots presence. Our efforts have resulted in the establishment of 234 block Congress committees, 2,145 mandal pradhans, 24,570 mandal committee members, and 117 halka coordinators.The dedication and hard work of these individuals have positioned the Congress party to secure the highest number of seats in the upcoming Lok Sabha elections in Punjab, even though we currently do not hold power at either the state or central level.\", 'Number of Words': 1184}\n",

India has unexplored opportunities – Warren Buffett (Pic: X – @WarrenBuffett and IRB) Washington: Attending the Berkshire Hathaway’s annual shareholder meeting, billionaire investor Warren Buffett expressed confordence in India’s growth story and stated that the Indian market has “unexplored” opportunities. Warren Buffett said the “unexplored” opportunities in India would likely be explored by Berkshire Hathaway in the future. The billionaire made the remarks when Rajeev Agarwal of DoorDarshi Advisors, asked him the possibility of Berkshire exploring in India. DoorDarshi Advisors is a US-based hedge fund that invests in Indian equities. “It is a very good question. I am sure there are loads of opportunities in countries like India,” Warren Buffet said. Elaborating his statement, the 93-year-old global investor said the investments in India would depend upon the likely advantages that can be degenerated from the businesses in the country. “The question, however, is whether we have any advantage or insights into those businesses in India or any contacts that will make possible transactions that Berkshire would like to participate in. That is something a more energetic management at Berkshire could pursue,” the co-founder, chairman and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway said. “There may be an unexplored or an unattended opportunity…but that may be something in the future,” he said about India. Speaking further about Berkshire’s possible investments in India, Warren Buffett said it will depend upon if Berkshire has some kind of advantage in pursuing those unattended opportunities, particularly against people who are managing other people’s money and getting paid based on assets. Buffett further responded to several questions related to some of the key investment decisions taken by Berkshire Hathway lately. Commenting on the decision to reduce stake in Apple, the global investor said that Apple will probably remain one of their largest holdings despite the recent slowdown. He exuded confidence in Vice Chairmen Greg Abel and Ajit Jain, saying that they have proven themselves to lead Berkshire after he departs.', 'Number of Words': 344}\n",

Power Finance Corporation (PFC) tanked 9 per cent to Rs 438.10 and REC slipped 7 per cent to Rs 519.60 on the BSE in the intraday trade.

In comparison, the S&P BSE Sensex was up 0.5 per cent at 74,242 at 09:29 AM. The RBI, on Friday, proposed to set a floor for banks\\' loan exposure for project finance for consortium lending and mandated 5 per cent standard asset in the construction phase. The central bank, in the draft guidelines on the financing of project loans, said, \"In projects financed under consortium arrangements, where the aggregate exposure of the participant lenders to the project is up to Rs 1,500 crore, no individual lender shall have an exposure which is less than 10 per cent of the aggregate exposure”. CLICK HERE FOR FULL REPORT Analysts at JM Financial Institutional Securities believe this will lead to a significant increase in provisioning requirement and will result in lower returns for lenders in project finance and reduce incremental appetite for such exposures, if implemented in current form. \"While this is prudent from a risk management perspective, coming from the regulator’s experience in the last credit cycle, we believe this can be detrimental to growth in the capital intensive infrastructure sectors in the economy,\" the brokerage firm said. What CLSA said on the development Analysts at CLSA, however, feel that there will be no impact on PFC\\'s and REC\\'s profit & loss (P&L) though the proposed norms will be a drag on their capital adequacy. \"Based on the banks\\' Pillar-3 disclosures, we estimated the additional credit costs for eight large banks under our coverage, if these guidelines were to to be issued in current form. We estimated additional credit costs in FY25 as 6/10/7/6 bps for HDFC Bank/ICICI Bank/Axis Bank/Kotak Bank. For PSBs, the incremental credit costs are expected in the range of 12-21bps,\" analysts said. \"The draft guideline is applicable for all lenders but non-bank finance companies (NBFCs) follow IndAs accounting. Per existing rules, the difference in provision requirements between RBI rules and IndAs will have to be adjusted via impairment reserves (equity line item). The overall impact on PFC and REC from higher standard asset will not be on their P&Ls but capital adeqyacy ratios. PFC\\'s and REC\\'s latest Tier 1 stood at 23 per cent - they are well capitalised,\" the CLSA note said. Lenders now have to maintain minimum exposure in a consortium and they can sell their exposure only after the construction phase is over. This, along with higher provision requirements, CLSA said, is a big deterrent. \"Private banks were anyway limited in their participation in thermal and hydro projects, and these new regulations may reduce the risk of higher competition from banks in the renewable segments as well,\" the CLSA note said.', 'Number of Words': 564}\n",

Chidambaram’s movie, which deftly combines the survival thriller with the male buddy drama, is out on Disney+ Hotstar. Manjummel Boys is based on a real-life incident from 2006. The film centres on a group of nine men in Kochi who have known each other since they were children. Long-term friendship is the single-most important factor that prevents the gang from abandoning Subhash when he slips into a pit in a cave. Convinced that Subhash is alive despite having fallen hundreds of feet, the friends maintain a vigil and then participate in a rescue operation that seems destined to fail. Malayalam cinema is often celebrated outside the state for elevating formulaic plots. By creating memorable characters, paying close attention to milieu-setting and relying on naturalistic performances, mainstream Malayalam productions make slice-of-life stories appear extraordinary. All these factors are at play in Manjummel Boys. Chidambaram’s screenplay takes elements that might have been exaggerated or glamourised elsewhere – in Telugu or Hindi cinema, for instance – to create a wholly plausible account of courage in impossible circumstances. The characters are from ordinary backgrounds who can barely afford a vacation. The performances lack showboating (also a stellar quality of Malayalam cinema). The magnificent cave set created by production designer Ajayan Chalissery and the textured camerawork by Shyju Khalid are always at the service of the plotting, rather than attempting to overshadow it. We first meet the men at a wedding, upending the occasion’s solemnity with their raucousness. The manner in which they freely argue is a sign of just how familiar they are with one another. They pile into a car driven by a tour operator for Kodaikanal in neighbouring Tamil Nadu. Their drunken revelry and unselfconscious antics mark them as the kind of travellers that other tourists tend to avoid, especially women. A cave popularised by the Tamil hit Gunaa (1991) is where the friendship is severely tested. The cave is the place where Kamal Haasan’s mentally disturbed character keeps his kidnapping victim, whom he believes to be a goddess. (The Hindu critic SR Praveen has also pointed to a predecessor to Manjummel Boys in Bharathan’s 1990 film Malootty). The obsession that Gunaa valourised, as well as a song from the film that celebrates divine love, are inventively reworked in Manjummel Boys. Siju (Soubin Sahir) and the rest of the gang are unwilling to let go of Subhash (Sreenath Bhasi). The group is bonded by a feeling that can only be described as love. Despite some disposable scenes that bloat the running length, Manjummel Boys is a riveting watch. The movie did great business in Tamil Nadu too, partly because of its Kodaikanal setting and Gunaa homage. There have been rumours of a Bollywood remake, which are hopefully as false as Manjummel Boys rings true.', 'Number of Words': 475}\n",

ADVERTISEMENT Final at Wembley on June 1 PSG will host Dortmund in the tie’s second leg on Tuesday, with Niclas Fuellkrug’s goal in Germany last week meaning Mbappe and his team need to win in order to have a chance of reaching the final at Wembley on June 1. “There’s a lot of pressure, which is normal because there’s a place in the Champions League final at stake, which is very important. Especially when you consider the club’s record in the competition,” said 25-year-old Mbappe. High-pressure game “We’re aware of the pressure, but the group is extremely calm. We’re confident that we’ll come back from that score and reach the final,” he said, adding that “taking part” in this event with the children helped him prepare. “I’ve often had the same warning from the children.

However the NYPD Deputy Commissioner of Public Information Tarik Sheppard and the New York Governor have stated that those arrested were not students but outside agitators.', 'Number of Words': 608}\n",

Yes, you read that right! Teaming up with Consul General of Italy Alessandro De Masi, Goila created this fusion dish. In a fun video, the celebrity chef shared the experience on Instagram and teased that Alessandro De Masi’s approval might determine his next trip to Italy. The chef was confident with his innovation and Alessandro instantly fell in love with the dish, even though he initially had doubts about some of the Goila’s ingredient choices. At the end of the video, the Consul General called the dish “Delishaaas.” In his recipe, Chef Saransh Goila suggests starting by soaking 6 papads in ice water and sprinkling some semolina on a board. Then, place the papads on the board, coat them and set them aside. Fill each papad generously with stuffing and roll them tightly. Prepare an oven tray by spreading butter on it, then arrange the papad pasta on it. Spread a layer of tomato sauce, sprinkle with parmesan and finally, bake at 170 degrees Celsius for 12 minutes until golden and crispy. Sharing the video on Instagram, Saransh Golia wrote, “Will the Italian Consul General like Papad Pasta? Will I get to go to Italy and feed people Papad Pasta? Huge respect and big hugs to Alessandro De Masi who sweetly agreed to come to Delishaaas HQ to try out version of Pasta. I’m hoping I made my Sindhi genes proud. It goes without saying that Papad Pasta Cannelloni was extra Delishaaas.” View this post on Instagram A post shared by Saransh Goila (@saranshgoila) Reacting to the clip, a user joked, “Nice attempt at Indian-Italian fusion, but the ‘Melodi’ trend will still be number one.” Another wrote, “Italy be ready for a Sindhi Papad brand.” “My Italian boss just fainted,” a comment read. An individual shared, “The Sindhi in me and the lover of Italian food in me are both dancing with so much joy.” Saransh Goila’s Instagram clip showcasing the innovative papad pasta dish has garnered over 23 lakh views.', 'Number of Words': 333}\n",
